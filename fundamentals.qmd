Tourism is transforming at an accelerated pace that has never been seen before, impacting consumers, businesses, and destinations alike. However, the reasons that are driving this moment of profound change are neither new nor exclusive to tourism. Throughout history, both society and businesses have witnessed other moments of dramatic change that paved the way for new structures, cultures, and behaviors to reach what we are today.

The First Industrial Revolution brought advances in the production of goods. The introduction of a new source of energy such as steam meant that many of the tasks that were previously carried out manually could be mechanized, leading to the emergence of production lines for the first time. At the end of the 19th century, the changes initiated in the First Revolution accelerated, giving rise to the Second Industrial Revolution, which led to the introduction of mass production. Since then, millions of consumers began to have access for the first time to thousands of products that were of good quality and affordable. Not many years passed until the Third Industrial Revolution, also called the Scientific-Technological Revolution, introduced the massive adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the means of production, thus facilitating the emergence of new distribution channels that broke the limits of trade at a geographical level and expanded it to all corners of the planet through e-commerce and advances in transport networks (Gaurav & Kongar, 2021). Our time in history is sustained by the unstoppable digital advance that has caused a drastic reduction in employment in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, while employment in the service sector has skyrocketed.

Has the history of human progress ceased since then? Of course not. History has not stopped being written for a single moment and has run its course inexorably, to the point that today we take for granted that the Third Industrial Revolution has been far surpassed and that we are living the dawn of a new revolution: the Fourth Revolution.

What makes our time different from other past times? Our time is distinguished by the massive incorporation of information and knowledge in everything we do, buy, or produce. We individuals have become accustomed to others doing the work for us, or at least making it easier for us -- with someone recommending us those products and services that best fit our personality, state of mind, or moment in life. We make decisions based on the experience that others before us have had when they bought a product or service, and we expect firms to do everything possible to adapt their services to our preferences and demands.

Have we all become spoiled children? Surely not. Still, we'd better examine how we got to this stage, which certainly hasn't been a bed of roses.

##The Origins of Smart Tourism

The road to where we are today has been littered with disruptive changes that 
previous generations had to respond to and adapt to, no doubt. Those people 
had to struggle to find the right mix of entrepreneurship, innovation, and technology adoption that would allow them to leap forward. Is it something different now? Not at all. Now it is our turn to do the same because we have entered a comparable historical moment.

In tourism, the rapid development of ICT has led to similar phases of progress that nonetheless have their own particularities. Until now, traditional tourism activities were based on close personal relationships, mutual trust, and personal attention. At a business level, the tourism ecosystem was dominated by a few large companies that influenced tourists' decisions almost at will, monopolizing value offers in the world's main tourism markets. On the other hand, consumers did not usually complain and accepted the conditions imposed by the big operators, grateful to be able to enjoy a vacation without unpleasant surprises and at prices adjusted to their purchasing power.

The advent of Google changed the rules of the game. The swift popularization of search engines allowed prospective tourists to access information from hundreds of tourism service providers and compare them in a matter of seconds. That was only the beginning of a story of sweeping changes to come in the way tourism consumers and businesses interacted, which continues to this day. Unimaginable new business models began to emerge that replaced many of the traditional models and sought to satisfy entirely new market niches and facilitate consumer decision-making. It was in these times that travel blogs, recommendation sites, and price comparison systems started to appear (Zsarnoczky, 2018).

The accelerated adoption of digital and online media by consumers meant that tourism firms had to start thinking very seriously about the need to change and adapt their "analog" products and services, if not to create them from scratch. Designing products from the perspective of the "new tourist" began to become a necessity. Since then, getting to know the "new tourist" in depth has become an integral part of the design of business models, and of products and
