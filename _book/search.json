    "text": "Tourism business owners and managers are at a critical tipping point. The business environment in which they operate has not only become intrinsically more competitive and complex but keeping up with innovation and disruption, while still managing day-to-day operations effectively and efficiently, has become a real challenge. With the advent of the 21st century, people and organizations have realized that we all live in an increasingly VUCA world, an acronym that all tourism professionals should be familiar with and that describes the increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world in which we live. Scholars and professionals now accept that firms are dynamic in nature, that change can happen at any time and come from anywhere, and that we have lost the ability to predict what is going to happen next in business and in our lives. Furthermore, the speed at which change occurs is so high that it is extremely difficult to make the right decision about the direction that our organizations should take. In this context, the unexpected is king and the rules that govern how firms operate are unequivocally different.\nThere are many reasons that can help us understand how we have arrived at this stage, including globalization, digitalization, geopolitical balances, as well as countless social and economic interconnections that operate at the macro and micro levels. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is still a key factor that is driving tourism firms towards this new era of rapid and accelerating change: technology. Advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) are raising consumer expectations and disrupting tourism ecosystems at a breakneck pace, to the point where a new generation of non-traditional data- and technology-focused competitors are driving a radical transformation of tourism. Technology is now embedded in the things we normally see and touch, but also in the things we don’t perceive (e.g., factory production lines, supply and delivery chains, etc.) having become ubiquitous. In fact, many analysts believe that we are already immersed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a new era characterized by cyber-physical systems that are creating radical breakthroughs in various fields of society at an extraordinary fast speed (Schwab, 2017).\nToday, everyone carries a smartphone in their pocket, is in constant communication with their friends, family, and co-workers in real time, and may even live in a house or drive a car that is “intelligent” (Kaivo-Oja et al., 2015). Consumer use of social media has reached unimaginable levels with the support of personal mobile and connected technologies, shaping the way people communicate with each other and with firms. The power of networks and crowds has increased substantially relative to major market leaders, causing changes in people’s social behavior, which, in turn, contain the seeds of a new system of values and beliefs. All these changes are even more noticeable in generations of people who were born between the 1980s and mid-1990s, the so-called Generation Y, whose communication and work habits have forever changed the way they interact with firms and how they make decisions (Burchardt & Maisch, 2019).\nThe impact of all these developments for tourism small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is materializing in a hyper-competitive business environment in which competitive advantages are only temporary (D’Aveni et al., 2010). Organizations need to constantly innovate to stay ahead of the competition and make a profit that vanishes all too quickly (Mariani et al., 2016). Even more worrying is that owners and managers can only expect these changes to continue to intensify further in the future as internet penetration consolidates and the entire population ends up connected via smart devices and highspeed broadband. Driven by these transformative conditions, digital and smart technologies are pushing tourism SMEs in new and somewhat unpredictable directions, providing unprecedented opportunities to develop new markets, develop new tourism products and services, and improve their competitive edge. No doubt these powerful trends towards accelerating change, technology adoption, and growing interconnectedness are fundamentally redefining the preferences and needs of the so-called “new tourist” (Pasca et al., 2021). The “new tourist” favors the use of mobile technologies and digital platforms, is much more informed, knowledgeable, and connected than ever, extraordinarily demanding, and expects services to be provided when and how she wants them, not how tourism firms want them to be (Zine et al., 2014).\nHowever, it is not all good news. Along with the new opportunities and promised big benefits, there are new risks and threats on the horizon for tourism firms. Smart technologies can create an uneven playing field in the business ecosystem, exacerbated by a widening gap between globally connected, data- and technology-driven tourism firms, and traditional micro and small firms whose business models are grounded in the low use and low investment in technology. This disparity is further accentuated as the world’s most innovative and highestvalue digital companies (e.g., Airbnb, Booking, HomeAway, Uber, etc.) coexist with the larger number of traditional tourism SMEs still struggling to understand the opportunities and reap the benefits of digitalization (OECD, 2019).\nFurthermore, reality is much more complex than anybody imagines, and business owners and managers should not consider technology as the only transformative factor that is pushing change hard. Although much of the attention of tourism leaders to date has focused on figuring out how to implement digital technologies, deciding which technology is best, or developing the skills needed to excel in the digital world, time has shown that technology is less effective in improving productivity and driving innovation in an increasingly global and competitive market. Owners and managers should be aware that people are just as important as technology. The leaders who mobilize their organizations to embrace change and provide innovative and effective responses to challenges, and the frontline employees who do their best to satisfy their demanding customers, are essential parts of the smart transformation puzzle.\nThis is the new normal. A time of profound and transformative change that no tourism firm can escape, no matter its size, location, or sector. All tourism firms are affected equally and strongly. So, you may be wondering right now, how can my business fully grasp the true dimension of the Smart Revolution and what it needs to do to address it effectively, given the myriad challenges it faces? This is exactly what this book is about. In it, owners and managers will find a support guide to understand the phenomenon and the true dimension of the Smart Revolution that tourism firms must tackle and will learn how to navigate these turbulent times by transforming the organization in the most effective and efficient way possible.\nLet me welcome you to this wonderful journey and make yourself comfortable. I hope that by reading this book you will discover a better future for yourself and for everyone in your organization.\nSee Knuth (1984) for additional discussion of literate programming.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.

    "text": "Tourism firms, like many in other industries, are not immune to digital disruptions and the deep structural and behavioral changes that digitalization is bringing about in the business ecosystem and in consumers. These disruptions manifest themselves in many different ways and to varying degrees, including the way tourism firms create value, the competitive landscape of tourism activities, or how firms communicate and engage with partners, suppliers, and customers. The variety, extent, and speed at which these developments are taking place are leaving tourism business owners and managers out of options, as the decision to tackle transformation is no longer a matter of choice, but a must that requires vision, determination, resources, and leadership among key members of the organization.\nFirms that do not invest enough in transformation will find it difficult to survive in the future (OECD, 2020), and those who do not achieve a constant pace of technology adoption and renewal will inevitably lose their competitive edge and the big opportunities ahead (i.e., for innovation and value creation). When digital technologies are used wisely, the potential for growth and improvement for tourism firms is phenomenal (Reddy & Reinartz, 2017). On the contrary, when digital technologies are used without intelligence, everything can end disastrously (Kaivo-Oja et al., 2015).\nIn this cumbersome context, SMEs are at high risk of being left behind, so it is essential that they start by re-examining their business end-to-end and redesigning it if they are to leverage on the promises and gain the benefits of transformation in terms of efficiency, agility, and competitiveness (Busulwa et al., 2020). Doing so requires not only that business owners and managers understand digital technologies and their implications (e.g., the impact of privacy, cybersecurity, business models, interoperability, scalability, ethics, ecosystems, etc.). It fundamentally requires firms to effectively lead transformation internally as a process that spans the entire organization, from senior management, through middle management, to front-line employees. This is no doubt a big ask for tourism SMEs, which surely explains why so many firms fall short of expectations and lag behind in this endurance race of transformation (Lv et al., 2021).\nIt is obvious that a large number of SMEs do not have anywhere near the resources, talented people, skills, and knowledge necessary to successfully tackle transformation. Although the latest innovations in the field of connectivity, networks, artificial intelligence, Big Data, analytics, and automation, to name just a few examples, are opening new windows of opportunity for SMEs, they are also much more sophisticated and far from the capacity of most SMEs to activate change (Earley, 2014). Furthermore, there are still deeply rooted beliefs in many SMEs about whether it is worth investing the time and money in transformation and turn the organization upside down, since it is hard to predict and quantify the true benefits that transformation can bring and when and where these benefits will emerge. Quite often bad past experiences in the execution of technological projects and mismatches in the realization of expectations have historically contributed to this disbelief.\nIt cannot be denied that there may be a good justification behind these attitudes. No one can attest today, be they consultants, scholars, or technologists, how much or at what precise moment in time transformation will improve customer satisfaction, or the service experience. Notwithstanding the above, it is equally true that no tourism firm can afford today to lose customers, manage its resources inefficiently, or assume failure simply because it is unable to decide in which direction its organization should point in today’s hyper-competitive and technology-centric environment (Nagle et al., 2013). The lack of a clear understanding of the strategic direction that the firm must follow and not having a tourism-specific roadmap focused on creating value (for the organization and the customer) are critical factors that very often prevent firms from advancing in the process of transformation that is needed (Udovita, 2020). Those running a tourism business must understand the fundamental nature of transformation and the implications that technological disruptions are having for organizations. Only after owners and managers are clear on what needs to change to close the gap can it become clear which strategy needs to be executed and which parts of the organization need to take the lead in the new strategic direction. With so much at stake, business leaders need to be aware that failure to act on the opportunities offered by transformation and digital technologies will have lethal consequences for the organization’s ability to survive in the future.\nFor all of the above reasons, this book is fundamentally a call to action for business leaders and organizations alike to get down to work as soon as possible and seize the vast pool of opportunities that exist and grow tourism firms in times of the Smart Revolution. To achieve this there are no shortcuts; only the knowledge, attitude, and resources to implement an action plan can help. That is why you have this book in your hands, so that those who run a tourism SME, or intend to do so, equip themselves with the most relevant knowledge and management practices to devise and implement a smart tourism transformation plan. Firms around the world are looking for leaders who are able to understand this complex world and who know how to address the opportunities of smartization. Now here is your chance to stand out from the crowd."

    "text": "The increasingly influential and sophisticated field of transformation and technology uses a specialized terminology that is often difficult for non-specialists to understand. Stop for a moment and think about all those acronyms, abbreviations, and jargon that are constantly heard and read, such as IoT, AI, Analytics, Big Data, or 5G. It is often difficult to know what they really mean. For many of the owners and managers who are approaching this growing field of knowledge and practice for the first time, or who are still at a beginning level, the language itself becomes a barrier to understanding the key issues. This not only happens with those who do not have prior technical training, but also with the most experienced practitioners due to constant innovation and the new practices and technologies that emerge every day.\nDespite these obvious difficulties, a large part of the reference books and training available on the subject are highly technical or academic and focus primarily on information technology or systems management. By doing so, most authors and trainers miss out on helping business owners and managers understand the terminology and fail to guide them through the process of business transformation and organizational improvement. In addition, owners and managers have grown accustomed to hearing about the phenomenal benefits that some “magic” technologies are bringing to companies, consumers, and society in general, but few people tell them about the failures and bad experiences of those who have tried it before and have not experienced the expected returns despite having invested large amounts of time and money in the process.\nTo fill this gap the book provides readers with an up-to-date framework to understand the key concepts, technologies, and management practices that are crucial to tackle the challenges of smartization and the underlying organizational transformation. Always using an eminently practical approach attached to reality and an perspective independent of the technology industry and consultants, the book highlights both the good things that smart technologies can bring to the tourism firm and the not-so-good things. Special attention is also devoted to the barriers and limitations that owners and managers will encounter in the transformation process and the mistakes that should be avoided.\nThe book delves into the world of digital and smart technologies from a managerial perspective, keeping technical details to the minimum necessary to facilitate understanding of concepts and ideas. It also highlights the opportunities that may arise from the implementation of more than ten key smart technologies, including Big Data, analytics, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, augmented and virtual reality, etc. and how they can shape the tourism firm’s strategy and operations. Furthermore, the book emphasizes the crucial role that people and organizational leaders play in harnessing smart technologies and enabling the organization to pursue efficiency, improve the tourism experience, and gain agility for sustainable competitive advantage. To conclude, an implementation framework that draws on best practices is provided that owners and managers can use as a roadmap to take the first steps in smart transformation and start reaping its benefits. Finally, the author offers his personal vision of what could be the next wave of innovation and disruption that is yet to come in the field of smartization and transformation and that could mark the future of tourism firms.\nA variety of discussion questions are provided throughout the chapters of the book to allow current and future business leaders to engage with the concepts and internalize the importance of the ideas presented. In cases where the book is used by groups of undergraduate or graduate students, this material can help stimulate class discussion about the relevance of the ideas presented by the instructor and thus achieve a more collaborative and experiential learning.\nAfter reading the book, anyone running a tourism SME should have a broader understanding of the relationships between organizational transformation, smart technologies, and the management practices that can unlock the wealth of opportunities that they offer. Whoever reads the book carefully should also be prepared to set a plan that optimizes the firm’s strategy and its operations in the context of the Smart Revolution and lead the organization towards the technological developments that are to come. Those readers will also understand that a successful smart transformation process does not depend solely on technology, but that the role that leadership and people play in mobilizing the organization and aligning it with common goals is essential. Ultimately, owners and managers who read the book will be more confident the next time they find themselves in a position to lead a transformation project within their organization or are asked by senior management to lend their support on transformation initiatives. They will surely be better equipped than others to serve as agents of change and contribute to increasing the firm’s performance by keeping up with the accelerated pace of change and innovation that characterizes the era of smart tourism."

    "text": "3.1 For Owners and Managers\nThe book is perfect for those owners and managers who are approaching the fundamentals of the Smart Revolution for the first time and want to acquire a comprehensive and holistic view of the consequences on the tourism firm from the perspective of organizational transformation and strategic management. In this case the book provides the reader an understanding of the key concepts that are shaping the Smart Revolution in tourism firms, as well as the factors that affect the creation and destruction of value in organizations and how to manage them.\nFor those owners and managers with a track record of managing technology disruption, change initiatives, or who have already embarked on digital/smart transformation processes, the book provides valuable guidance to further explore the management framework that is applicable to the tourism firm to succeed in implementing the smart transformation and unlock its benefits.\nAlthough each chapter has been written to be read and understood on its own, it is highly recommended that beginning and experienced owners and managers alike first read the book from cover to cover before deciding to skip to specific chapters. This will allow them to get a more detailed insight into the key concepts, the relationships between them, and the consequences that arise for the management of the smart transformation in the tourism firm. Experienced owners and managers will thus be able to update their understanding of the main building blocks that shape modern smart transformation and the new management practices that have emerged to harness them. However, if owners and managers feel that they have enough knowledge and experience or are already familiar with the key ideas in this book, they are free to skip directly to the parts or chapters of the book that are of most help or interest to them."

    "text": "The book is structured in four major parts:\n\nIntroduction to Smart firms\nSmart Technologies\nManagement Practices\nWhat’s Next.\n\nPart 1 includes four chapters that introduce the key ideas and concepts that are shaping business transformation and smartization in organizations around the world, and especially in tourism firms. Part 2 focuses on understanding the technologies that are the basis of the Smart Revolution, not from a deep technical or functional perspective, but from the positive (and negative) impacts that their implementation is starting to have, and the transformation needs for the tourism firm. Part 3 contains six chapters that examine some of the main management practices that tourism organizations should consider implementing in order to make a successful transition from conventional to smart firm. Finally, Part 4 aims to guide business leaders in the first steps of the smart business transformation process, as well as to suggest some of the trends that will continue to disrupt tourism firms in the future.\nEach of the 23 chapters of the book is self-contained and can be studied on its own. However, the author recommends that the reader make a first complete reading of the book from beginning to end and follow the established order of the parts and chapters. In this way, the reader will better comprehend the key concepts covered in the book, the relationships between them, and the consequences for the smart management of the tourism firm. After a first reading of the book, readers will realize the true dimension of the Smart Revolution and will feel more comfortable to later delve into specific chapters to review or search for ideas, learn more through the references provided or use the discussion questions at the end of the chapters to stimulate debate and reflection."
