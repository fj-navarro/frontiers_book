    "text": "Tourism business owners and managers are at a critical tipping point. The business environment in which they operate has not only become intrinsically more competitive and complex but keeping up with innovation and disruption, while still managing day-to-day operations effectively and efficiently, has become a real challenge. With the advent of the 21st century, people and organizations have realized that we all live in an increasingly VUCA world, an acronym that all tourism professionals should be familiar with and that describes the increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world in which we live. Scholars and professionals now accept that firms are dynamic in nature, that change can happen at any time and come from anywhere, and that we have lost the ability to predict what is going to happen next in business and in our lives. Furthermore, the speed at which change occurs is so high that it is extremely difficult to make the right decision about the direction that our organizations should take. In this context, the unexpected is king and the rules that govern how firms operate are unequivocally different.\nThere are many reasons that can help us understand how we have arrived at this stage, including globalization, digitalization, geopolitical balances, as well as countless social and economic interconnections that operate at the macro and micro levels. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is still a key factor that is driving tourism firms towards this new era of rapid and accelerating change: technology. Advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) are raising consumer expectations and disrupting tourism ecosystems at a breakneck pace, to the point where a new generation of non-traditional data- and technology-focused competitors are driving a radical transformation of tourism. Technology is now embedded in the things we normally see and touch, but also in the things we don’t perceive (e.g., factory production lines, supply and delivery chains, etc.) having become ubiquitous. In fact, many analysts believe that we are already immersed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a new era characterized by cyber-physical systems that are creating radical breakthroughs in various fields of society at an extraordinary fast speed (Schwab, 2017).\nToday, everyone carries a smartphone in their pocket, is in constant communication with their friends, family, and co-workers in real time, and may even live in a house or drive a car that is “intelligent” (Kaivo-Oja et al., 2015). Consumer use of social media has reached unimaginable levels with the support of personal mobile and connected technologies, shaping the way people communicate with each other and with firms. The power of networks and crowds has increased substantially relative to major market leaders, causing changes in people’s social behavior, which, in turn, contain the seeds of a new system of values and beliefs. All these changes are even more noticeable in generations of people who were born between the 1980s and mid-1990s, the so-called Generation Y, whose communication and work habits have forever changed the way they interact with firms and how they make decisions (Burchardt & Maisch, 2019).\nThe impact of all these developments for tourism small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is materializing in a hyper-competitive business environment in which competitive advantages are only temporary (D’Aveni et al., 2010). Organizations need to constantly innovate to stay ahead of the competition and make a profit that vanishes all too quickly (Mariani et al., 2016). Even more worrying is that owners and managers can only expect these changes to continue to intensify further in the future as internet penetration consolidates and the entire population ends up connected via smart devices and highspeed broadband. Driven by these transformative conditions, digital and smart technologies are pushing tourism SMEs in new and somewhat unpredictable directions, providing unprecedented opportunities to develop new markets, develop new tourism products and services, and improve their competitive edge. No doubt these powerful trends towards accelerating change, technology adoption, and growing interconnectedness are fundamentally redefining the preferences and needs of the so-called “new tourist” (Pasca et al., 2021). The “new tourist” favors the use of mobile technologies and digital platforms, is much more informed, knowledgeable, and connected than ever, extraordinarily demanding, and expects services to be provided when and how she wants them, not how tourism firms want them to be (Zine et al., 2014).\nHowever, it is not all good news. Along with the new opportunities and promised big benefits, there are new risks and threats on the horizon for tourism firms. Smart technologies can create an uneven playing field in the business ecosystem, exacerbated by a widening gap between globally connected, data- and technology-driven tourism firms, and traditional micro and small firms whose business models are grounded in the low use and low investment in technology. This disparity is further accentuated as the world’s most innovative and highestvalue digital companies (e.g., Airbnb, Booking, HomeAway, Uber, etc.) coexist with the larger number of traditional tourism SMEs still struggling to understand the opportunities and reap the benefits of digitalization (OECD, 2019).\nFurthermore, reality is much more complex than anybody imagines, and business owners and managers should not consider technology as the only transformative factor that is pushing change hard. Although much of the attention of tourism leaders to date has focused on figuring out how to implement digital technologies, deciding which technology is best, or developing the skills needed to excel in the digital world, time has shown that technology is less effective in improving productivity and driving innovation in an increasingly global and competitive market. Owners and managers should be aware that people are just as important as technology. The leaders who mobilize their organizations to embrace change and provide innovative and effective responses to challenges, and the frontline employees who do their best to satisfy their demanding customers, are essential parts of the smart transformation puzzle.\nThis is the new normal. A time of profound and transformative change that no tourism firm can escape, no matter its size, location, or sector. All tourism firms are affected equally and strongly. So, you may be wondering right now, how can my business fully grasp the true dimension of the Smart Revolution and what it needs to do to address it effectively, given the myriad challenges it faces? This is exactly what this book is about. In it, owners and managers will find a support guide to understand the phenomenon and the true dimension of the Smart Revolution that tourism firms must tackle and will learn how to navigate these turbulent times by transforming the organization in the most effective and efficient way possible.\nLet me welcome you to this wonderful journey and make yourself comfortable. I hope that by reading this book you will discover a better future for yourself and for everyone in your organization.\nSee Knuth (1984) for additional discussion of literate programming.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.

    "text": "Tourism firms, like many in other industries, are not immune to digital disruptions and the deep structural and behavioral changes that digitalization is bringing about in the business ecosystem and in consumers. These disruptions manifest themselves in many different ways and to varying degrees, including the way tourism firms create value, the competitive landscape of tourism activities, or how firms communicate and engage with partners, suppliers, and customers. The variety, extent, and speed at which these developments are taking place are leaving tourism business owners and managers out of options, as the decision to tackle transformation is no longer a matter of choice, but a must that requires vision, determination, resources, and leadership among key members of the organization.\nFirms that do not invest enough in transformation will find it difficult to survive in the future (OECD, 2020), and those who do not achieve a constant pace of technology adoption and renewal will inevitably lose their competitive edge and the big opportunities ahead (i.e., for innovation and value creation). When digital technologies are used wisely, the potential for growth and improvement for tourism firms is phenomenal (Reddy & Reinartz, 2017). On the contrary, when digital technologies are used without intelligence, everything can end disastrously (Kaivo-Oja et al., 2015).\nIn this cumbersome context, SMEs are at high risk of being left behind, so it is essential that they start by re-examining their business end-to-end and redesigning it if they are to leverage on the promises and gain the benefits of transformation in terms of efficiency, agility, and competitiveness (Busulwa et al., 2020). Doing so requires not only that business owners and managers understand digital technologies and their implications (e.g., the impact of privacy, cybersecurity, business models, interoperability, scalability, ethics, ecosystems, etc.). It fundamentally requires firms to effectively lead transformation internally as a process that spans the entire organization, from senior management, through middle management, to front-line employees. This is no doubt a big ask for tourism SMEs, which surely explains why so many firms fall short of expectations and lag behind in this endurance race of transformation (Lv et al., 2021).\nIt is obvious that a large number of SMEs do not have anywhere near the resources, talented people, skills, and knowledge necessary to successfully tackle transformation. Although the latest innovations in the field of connectivity, networks, artificial intelligence, Big Data, analytics, and automation, to name just a few examples, are opening new windows of opportunity for SMEs, they are also much more sophisticated and far from the capacity of most SMEs to activate change (Earley, 2014). Furthermore, there are still deeply rooted beliefs in many SMEs about whether it is worth investing the time and money in transformation and turn the organization upside down, since it is hard to predict and quantify the true benefits that transformation can bring and when and where these benefits will emerge. Quite often bad past experiences in the execution of technological projects and mismatches in the realization of expectations have historically contributed to this disbelief.\nIt cannot be denied that there may be a good justification behind these attitudes. No one can attest today, be they consultants, scholars, or technologists, how much or at what precise moment in time transformation will improve customer satisfaction, or the service experience. Notwithstanding the above, it is equally true that no tourism firm can afford today to lose customers, manage its resources inefficiently, or assume failure simply because it is unable to decide in which direction its organization should point in today’s hyper-competitive and technology-centric environment (Nagle et al., 2013). The lack of a clear understanding of the strategic direction that the firm must follow and not having a tourism-specific roadmap focused on creating value (for the organization and the customer) are critical factors that very often prevent firms from advancing in the process of transformation that is needed (Udovita, 2020). Those running a tourism business must understand the fundamental nature of transformation and the implications that technological disruptions are having for organizations. Only after owners and managers are clear on what needs to change to close the gap can it become clear which strategy needs to be executed and which parts of the organization need to take the lead in the new strategic direction. With so much at stake, business leaders need to be aware that failure to act on the opportunities offered by transformation and digital technologies will have lethal consequences for the organization’s ability to survive in the future.\nFor all of the above reasons, this book is fundamentally a call to action for business leaders and organizations alike to get down to work as soon as possible and seize the vast pool of opportunities that exist and grow tourism firms in times of the Smart Revolution. To achieve this there are no shortcuts; only the knowledge, attitude, and resources to implement an action plan can help. That is why you have this book in your hands, so that those who run a tourism SME, or intend to do so, equip themselves with the most relevant knowledge and management practices to devise and implement a smart tourism transformation plan. Firms around the world are looking for leaders who are able to understand this complex world and who know how to address the opportunities of smartization. Now here is your chance to stand out from the crowd."

    "text": "The increasingly influential and sophisticated field of transformation and technology uses a specialized terminology that is often difficult for non-specialists to understand. Stop for a moment and think about all those acronyms, abbreviations, and jargon that are constantly heard and read, such as IoT, AI, Analytics, Big Data, or 5G. It is often difficult to know what they really mean. For many of the owners and managers who are approaching this growing field of knowledge and practice for the first time, or who are still at a beginning level, the language itself becomes a barrier to understanding the key issues. This not only happens with those who do not have prior technical training, but also with the most experienced practitioners due to constant innovation and the new practices and technologies that emerge every day.\nDespite these obvious difficulties, a large part of the reference books and training available on the subject are highly technical or academic and focus primarily on information technology or systems management. By doing so, most authors and trainers miss out on helping business owners and managers understand the terminology and fail to guide them through the process of business transformation and organizational improvement. In addition, owners and managers have grown accustomed to hearing about the phenomenal benefits that some “magic” technologies are bringing to companies, consumers, and society in general, but few people tell them about the failures and bad experiences of those who have tried it before and have not experienced the expected returns despite having invested large amounts of time and money in the process.\nTo fill this gap the book provides readers with an up-to-date framework to understand the key concepts, technologies, and management practices that are crucial to tackle the challenges of smartization and the underlying organizational transformation. Always using an eminently practical approach attached to reality and an perspective independent of the technology industry and consultants, the book highlights both the good things that smart technologies can bring to the tourism firm and the not-so-good things. Special attention is also devoted to the barriers and limitations that owners and managers will encounter in the transformation process and the mistakes that should be avoided.\nThe book delves into the world of digital and smart technologies from a managerial perspective, keeping technical details to the minimum necessary to facilitate understanding of concepts and ideas. It also highlights the opportunities that may arise from the implementation of more than ten key smart technologies, including Big Data, analytics, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, augmented and virtual reality, etc. and how they can shape the tourism firm’s strategy and operations. Furthermore, the book emphasizes the crucial role that people and organizational leaders play in harnessing smart technologies and enabling the organization to pursue efficiency, improve the tourism experience, and gain agility for sustainable competitive advantage. To conclude, an implementation framework that draws on best practices is provided that owners and managers can use as a roadmap to take the first steps in smart transformation and start reaping its benefits. Finally, the author offers his personal vision of what could be the next wave of innovation and disruption that is yet to come in the field of smartization and transformation and that could mark the future of tourism firms.\nA variety of discussion questions are provided throughout the chapters of the book to allow current and future business leaders to engage with the concepts and internalize the importance of the ideas presented. In cases where the book is used by groups of undergraduate or graduate students, this material can help stimulate class discussion about the relevance of the ideas presented by the instructor and thus achieve a more collaborative and experiential learning.\nAfter reading the book, anyone running a tourism SME should have a broader understanding of the relationships between organizational transformation, smart technologies, and the management practices that can unlock the wealth of opportunities that they offer. Whoever reads the book carefully should also be prepared to set a plan that optimizes the firm’s strategy and its operations in the context of the Smart Revolution and lead the organization towards the technological developments that are to come. Those readers will also understand that a successful smart transformation process does not depend solely on technology, but that the role that leadership and people play in mobilizing the organization and aligning it with common goals is essential. Ultimately, owners and managers who read the book will be more confident the next time they find themselves in a position to lead a transformation project within their organization or are asked by senior management to lend their support on transformation initiatives. They will surely be better equipped than others to serve as agents of change and contribute to increasing the firm’s performance by keeping up with the accelerated pace of change and innovation that characterizes the era of smart tourism."

In this case the book provides the reader an understanding of the key concepts that are shaping the Smart Revolution in tourism firms, as well as the factors that affect the creation and destruction of value in organizations and how to manage them.\nFor those owners and managers with a track record of managing technology disruption, change initiatives, or who have already embarked on digital/smart transformation processes, the book provides valuable guidance to further explore the management framework that is applicable to the tourism firm to succeed in implementing the smart transformation and unlock its benefits.\nAlthough each chapter has been written to be read and understood on its own, it is highly recommended that beginning and experienced owners and managers alike first read the book from cover to cover before deciding to skip to specific chapters. This will allow them to get a more detailed insight into the key concepts, the relationships between them, and the consequences that arise for the management of the smart transformation in the tourism firm. Experienced owners and managers will thus be able to update their understanding of the main building blocks that shape modern smart transformation and the new management practices that have emerged to harness them. However, if owners and managers feel that they have enough knowledge and experience or are already familiar with the key ideas in this book, they are free to skip directly to the parts or chapters of the book that are of most help or interest to them."

Part 2 focuses on understanding the technologies that are the basis of the Smart Revolution, not from a deep technical or functional perspective, but from the positive (and negative) impacts that their implementation is starting to have, and the transformation needs for the tourism firm. Part 3 contains six chapters that examine some of the main management practices that tourism organizations should consider implementing in order to make a successful transition from conventional to smart firm. Finally, Part 4 aims to guide business leaders in the first steps of the smart business transformation process, as well as to suggest some of the trends that will continue to disrupt tourism firms in the future.\nEach of the 23 chapters of the book is self-contained and can be studied on its own. However, the author recommends that the reader make a first complete reading of the book from beginning to end and follow the established order of the parts and chapters. In this way, the reader will better comprehend the key concepts covered in the book, the relationships between them, and the consequences for the smart management of the tourism firm. After a first reading of the book, readers will realize the true dimension of the Smart Revolution and will feel more comfortable to later delve into specific chapters to review or search for ideas, learn more through the references provided or use the discussion questions at the end of the chapters to stimulate debate and reflection."

    "section": "5.1 The Origins of Smart Tourism",
    "text": "5.1 The Origins of Smart Tourism\nThe road to where we are today has been littered with disruptive changes that previous generations had to respond to and adapt to, no doubt. Those people had to struggle to find the right mix of entrepreneurship, innovation, and technology adoption that would allow them to leap forward. Is it something different now? Not at all. Now it is our turn to do the same because we have entered a comparable historical moment.\nIn tourism, the rapid development of ICT has led to similar phases of progress that nonetheless have their own particularities. Until now, traditional tourism activities were based on close personal relationships, mutual trust, and personal attention. At a business level, the tourism ecosystem was dominated by a few large companies that influenced tourists’ decisions almost at will, monopolizing value offers in the world’s main tourism markets. On the other hand, consumers did not usually complain and accepted the conditions imposed by the big operators, grateful to be able to enjoy a vacation without unpleasant surprises and at prices adjusted to their purchasing power.\nThe advent of Google changed the rules of the game. The swift popularization of search engines allowed prospective tourists to access information from hundreds of tourism service providers and compare them in a matter of seconds. That was only the beginning of a story of sweeping changes to come in the way tourism consumers and businesses interacted, which continues to this day. Unimaginable new business models began to emerge that replaced many of the traditional models and sought to satisfy entirely new market niches and facilitate consumer decision-making. It was in these times that travel blogs, recommendation sites, and price comparison systems started to appear (Zsarnoczky, 2018).\nThe accelerated adoption of digital and online media by consumers meant that tourism firms had to start thinking very seriously about the need to change and adapt their “analog” products and services, if not to create them from scratch. Designing products from the perspective of the “new tourist” began to become a necessity. Since then, getting to know the “new tourist” in depth has become an integral part of the design of business models, and of products and services. Nowadays it would be simply unthinkable for a tourism firm to survive in the market without having this knowledge.\nChallenged by this avalanche of sweeping changes in the way tourism firms are required to operate, many firms have simply been unable to keep up with the pace of change and have been left out of the market. This would explain the renewal that the tourism ecosystem has experienced in recent years at the business level. Figure 5.1 illustrates the evolution described, from traditional tour operators with a low level of digitalization to the present day, characterized by the digital transformation of operators and the growing but unstoppable integration of smart technologies in tourism firms.\n\n5.1.1 Phase 1: Traditional tourism\nThis phase is characterized by the pervasive influence of tourism service providers on consumer decision-making, as they dominate the tourism ecosystem at a global level. The adoption of ICT by tourism firms is still very low and most are largely unaware of the individual tastes and preferences of their customers.\nInstead, management’s focus is more on continuous quality improvement, the efficient operation of processes, and the generation of economies of scale to improve commercial margins.\n\n\n5.1.2 Phase 2: e-Tourism\nThis second phase (1990–2000) is marked by the integration of the internet into the daily lives of consumers and tourism firms. Firms realize the need to be on the internet to serve a growing number of potential customers and the great potential of the World Wide Web as a sales and marketing tool.Nonetheless, communication with customers remains rudimentary and mostly one-way (e.g., via phone, email, and electronic forms). The websites of tourism firms become shop windows open 24 hours a day to any customer in the world regardless of their physical location, and owners and managers begin to see the electronic channel as a promising source of income generation. Paper is replaced as the main support in communications with customers and tourism firms starting to mass-produce digital content, aware that it can be delivered instantly to the people. New electronic and online marketing tools emerge that contribute to improving business performance.\n\n\n5.1.3 Phase 3: Digital tourism\nIn the next decade (years 2000–2010), the internet consolidates as the main source of information for tourists, and the main channel through which information is shared between consumers and firms. New internet technologies open up the possibility for consumers to search and compare information for their trips in a matter of seconds and for firms to create transactional gateways for their products and services. New intermediaries appear that develop business models unknown until this moment. The consumer becomes a co-creator of content and has a much more influential role in decision-making. Traditional operators are forced to transform their business models if they want to survive, meaning that they need to establish much closer ties with their customers and be willing to personalize their product and service offerings. On the other hand, customers begin to think of tourism as an experience that they themselves are willing to create, and the traditional view of the product or service that cannot be controlled is surpassed.\n\n\n5.1.4 Phase 4: Smart tourism\nStarting from 2010, advances in mobile technologies, communication networks, and cloud computing, accompanied by increasing integration and interoperability between the physical and digital worlds, lay the foundation for the transition to the era of smart tourism. Combined with social networks and Web 2.0 platforms that facilitate two-way communication with consumers, the possibility of co-creating new experiences with users becomes a reality in this phase. All the above creates the opportunity for firms to obtain an amount of data like never before. From now on, the ability to exploit data and turn it into actionable knowledge becomes a crucial factor for firms to create competitive advantages and thrive in the marketplace."

    "section": "5.2 Definition of Smart Tourism",
    "text": "5.2 Definition of Smart Tourism\nNo one doubts that the term smart has become a buzzword nowadays. It is not only used as an adjective to describe people or animals, but we can practically find it in anything that incorporates some technology with which we can interact in a more “intelligent” way, that is, faster, automatic, intuitive, or more efficient (e.g., a television, a sports watch, a motor vehicle, etc.) (Poslad, 2011). The Oxford English Dictionary defines the term smart as something “smart” “controlled by a computer, so that it seems to act intelligently”. So we can ask ourselves, how is the term intelligent defined? In the case of a person, it is the ability to understand and learn things. In the case of a computer or program, it is the ability to store information and use it in new situations.\nAlthough these definitions give us a rough idea of what the term smart means, the truth is that intelligent and smart have some differences that should be considered, especially when we are in a business context. “Smart” usually refers to the ability to adapt to changing situations caused by different customer needs, past experiences, or particular environmental conditions. In this context, technology is one of the key drivers that would enable organizations to speed up response to changing conditions. In “intelligent tourism”, tourists become passive consumers who are offered various options among which they must “intelligently” choose the one that best suits their needs. Different levels of intelligence would thus lead to different types of services and experiences.\nIn this book, the term smart is used to refer to state-of-the-art information systems and processes that provide tourists and firms with relevant information, facilitate better decision-making, greater mobility, and a more pleasurable experience in accordance with the preferences and needs of the tourist at all times (Pinheiro et al., 2021). Smart information systems encompass a wide range of technologies, which can be very useful for the tourism firm depending on the environment and the stage of the experience cycle in which they are used. Some examples include recommendation systems, environmental sensing systems, and ambient intelligence systems. Notwithstanding the foregoing, owners and managers must be aware that the term smart not only covers information systems and digital technologies, but also denotes a process that we will call “smartization”, which transcends the mere technological dimension and implicitly affects other core organizational components such as innovation, leadership, and human capital (Boes et al., 2015). In a similar fashion, when we talk about the adoption of a higher degree of “smartness” through the transformation of the organization, we will be referring to a process that is intrinsically different from the implementation of conventional technologies, and that has a strong relationship with the management practices that must be used to accommodate change within the organization.\nSo, now that we have an idea of what smart means in this book, what do we mean by smart tourism? The notion of smart tourism is a reflection of the profound impact that smart technologies are having on the tourism consumer and on the products and services (Mehraliyev et al., 2020). The importance of smart technologies is increasing as the role of tourism consumers and firms is changing, and with it the boundaries of the tourism ecosystem. Smart tourism is a much broader notion than intelligent tourism, as it emphasizes the results that technology can offer tourists and that require a large amount of information and data to materialize. In smart tourism firms need tourists to be active all the time so that they can provide a huge amount of information that can be collected, processed, analyzed, and transformed into individualized knowledge by firms to deliver accurate products and services to tourists. Whereas smart tourism relies heavily on the availability of data and data processing capabilities to anticipate the needs of tourists, intelligent tourism provides a much more basic utility from the available data and information. As an example, the process of generating a travel route automatically from a small number of inputs provided by the user through a mobile application to which an optimization algorithm is applied, is intelligent. If in the same process information is added about the user’s experience, information about the location where the user is or wants to go, or other information about the user’s buyer profile, personality, etc., this is smart (Y. Li et al., 2017).\nIn summary, smart tourism involves the use of technologies to collect and exploit large amounts of data and provide real-time service delivery to tourists. These so-called smart technologies are not only the internet and mobile devices used to communicate, but also include the infrastructure that integrates hardware, software, and communications, as well as networks that provide real-time data to facilitate faster and more efficient decision-making for stakeholders (Dorcic et al., 2019; Gretzel et al., 2015a). Ultimately, the use of smart technologies by tourism firms largely depends on their ability to collect data in large quantities that can then be transformed into useful knowledge."

    "section": "5.3 What Is Smart Tourism For?",
    "text": "5.3 What Is Smart Tourism For?\nThe debate in academic and professional forums is still ongoing in trying to reach a definitive and widely accepted conclusion of what smart tourism is and what its main components are. Unfortunately, on many occasions these discussions lead to ideas of little use to owners and managers, who are more concerned with understanding the phenomenon of smartization and how to benefit from it than with theoretical discussions that contribute little or nothing to improving the performance of their business.\nThe fundamentals of smart tourism lie in the tourist. The new applications of smart tourism are activated by the behavior of tourists, so changes in their needs and demands are the real driving force of smart tourism. Any benefits derived from smart tourism will arise from the needs of tourists and changes in their behavior (Y. Li et al., 2017). Consequently, the role of the tourist as an informational asset is essential, as evidenced by the fact that the value of information for tourists, tourism firms, and destinations has not stopped growing in recent years. Without tourist information there simply cannot be smart tourism.\n\n5.3.1 For tourists\nSmart tourism provides tourists with access to more comprehensive, portable,and personalized information based on their needs, allowing them to organize and fine-tune the tourism experience more quickly and accurately. For more and better information to be accessible, tourists must provide relevant connected data about their behavior, demands, or personality, so that tourism firms can deliver accurate digital informational resources at their fingertips (e.g., text, pictures, video) through a variety of devices and technologies. The type of value that tourists obtain in exchange for the data they provide is independent of the way in which tourism firms collect and process that data about their behavior and needs.\n\n\n5.3.2 For owners and managers\nSmart tourism is about building an integrated framework of services and technologies that is comprehensive and provides the tourist with a range of services that are accurate, convenient, and ubiquitous. From a technical perspective, such a framework allows for continuous interaction between the assets of the firm (more specifically between the digital representation of those assets) and the tourist needs to create more meaningful relationships with tourists. In this way, smart tourism provides tourists with entirely new ways of consuming tourism services, and tourism firms with new possibilities to create value through innovative combinations of tourism information, services, and technologies.\nReaders should note that not all tourist information falls within the scope of smart tourism. Indeed, tourists can obtain valuable information from very different sources. Sometimes the information will come from websites; other times from social networks, or even from the tourist information offices of a destination. However, only the information that is ubiquitous and that is delivered to the tourist according to their individual requirements is what we will call smart tourism."

    "section": "5.4 Components of Smart Tourism",
    "text": "5.4 Components of Smart Tourism\nIt is not an easy job trying to summarize in a few pages the most important components that characterize smart tourism and that distinguish it from conventional tourism. Nor could it be exhaustive because any attempt to do so would require much more extensive work. Most likely, it would not be of much value to the reader either since the very idea of smart tourism is not yet fully developed. Even so, the components with which every owner and manager should be familiar and that most directly affect the tourism firm are described below.\nOne of the main components of smart tourism is tourist information. In smart tourism, information is no longer that old static information aimed at poorly differentiated groups of consumers that was delivered through a few channels enabled by firms in a rather unstructured way. In contrast, the information in smart tourism is ubiquitous, and is created to meet the individual needs of the tourist. The ubiquity of information means that tourists can easily access information from anywhere, at any time, and through any type of media on the internet. Access to tourist information is provided through devices that are part of everyday life for most people and that provide tourists with a large portable computing capacity, such as mobile devices, portable devices, and other non-conventional means. The very idea of ubiquity implies that, through smart tourism, people have overcome the limitation of having to sit in front of a desktop computer to access tourist information and services. Instead, it involves a radically new way of shaping space and time to the individual needs of the tourist.\nUbiquity, however, not only encompasses information, but also the tourism firm itself, to the point that we could speak of the “ubiquitous firm”. These are firms that have the ability to provide, optimize, and improve services as they are delivered, using ubiquitous marketing, ubiquitous supply chain, and ubiquitous management. The target of the ubiquitous firm is no longer the group of tourists (understood as a set of consumers who share certain attributes that make them similar in the eyes of the firm and for whom generic products and services are created), but the tourist as an individual. This means that smart tourism firms remain focused on individuals with special needs, who have an autonomous behavior that makes them different from other tourists and with the ability to establish their own preferences through the (ubiquitous and bidirectional) communication channels made available by the firm.\nSmart tourism firms devote their resources (e.g., people, money, infrastructure, etc.) to create and capture value from the data generated by the behavior of tourists at any given time. This is what we call business development the smart way. In other words, smart tourism firms’ development depends to a great extent on Big Data and their ability to extract value from it through more relevant relationships with tourists and improved products/services. To create more relevant relationships between tourists and firms another key component must be considered: the smart tourism ecosystem.\nSmart tourism firms operate within an ecosystem in which tourism products/ services (and experiences) are created, managed, and delivered through smart technologies. These technologies are very special because they require the intensive use and constant exchange of information resources to, from, and between tourists, tourism firms, and destinations, to create shared value from the Big Data (Gretzel et al., 2015b). Smart technologies are basically those ICTs that allow constant communication and interaction with tourists, from whose behavior and demands data is extracted that can later be exploited by the tourism firm to generate useful knowledge for the business. Note that the smart tourism ecosystem would simply not work if the actors involved were isolated or separated from each other. They must be connected through (smart) technologies, with the tourist located in the center so that the smart ecosystem can work properly.\nThis tourist-centric approach that characterizes smart tourism is part of its idiosyncrasy and is another of the key components that differentiate it from conventional tourism. Business owners and managers should not forget that smart tourism is created with the aim of satisfying the individual travel, mobility, accommodation, catering, and leisure needs of tourists based on their personal preferences. The tourist-centric approach of tourism firms is made possible thanks to the rapid advances and intensive use of smart technologies (e.g., Big Data, analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, mobile and network technologies with high computing capacity and connectivity). The adoption of smart technologies into the consumption habits of tourists has forever transformed the way they consume tourism products/services and enjoy tourism experiences.\nTourism firms’ use of smart (customer-centric) technologies puts them in a privileged position to meet the individual demands of tourists and improve satisfaction levels. It also provides tourism firms with the opportunity to radically improve their products/services and revamp tourism experiences through the implementation of new and innovative management practices that optimize the use of internal and external resources and are aimed at co-creating value with tourists, destinations, and the ICT industry. In short, smart tourism with all its components constitutes a framework for action to improve the management of tourism firms that can contribute very significantly to improving their competitiveness and performance."

    "section": "5.5 Impact of Smart Tourism",
    "text": "5.5 Impact of Smart Tourism\nThe process of change towards smartization is a breakthrough that confirms the transition of the tourism sector towards a modern service industry. This process brings highly relevant impacts that will undoubtedly be the catalysts for the future developments of tourism in the coming years. As we have seen, smart tourism builds on top of earlier phases of social and business development, when everything was more focused on the informatization and digitization of the tourism business. That is why it is worth examining the most notorious impacts that smart tourism is having on consumers and firms.\n\n5.5.1 Impacts on tourism firms\nOne of the key benefits of smart tourism for firms is that it provides a two-way communication channel between tourism firms, tourists and the rest of the actors involved in the value chain. “Smart channels” are created that operate as high-speed highways through which a constant flow of data and information circulates and is disseminated in a rather personalized and efficient way among all tourism stakeholders. In this way, smart tourism strongly impacts the commercialization and marketing of tourism products/services, given the variety of media that can be used (e.g., text, images, videos, and hybrid combinations), the ability to monitor the demand and quality of the services provided, and the possibility of quantitatively measuring the performance of campaigns.\nFrom a management perspective, smart tourism offers tourism firms the opportunity to configure their own value offer to the customer in a quite flexible way, activating a much deeper knowledge about the customer that translates into delivering information, products, and services in accordance with the location and the requirements of the customer. However, achieving “smartness” is not straightforward. It requires the firm to redesign its internal processes, so that integration with smart technologies is seamless and contributes to improving the operational efficiency of the firm’s business. For example, a hotel can have room check-in and check-out done via radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems, or the tourist can read a menu, book a table, and have access to entertainment services in the room all through the same mobile device.\nOne consequence of the above is that the tourism firm can end up optimizing itself thanks to smart tourism while changing the way it relates to the customer. The customer, in turn, may change behavior when searching for information and consuming tourism products/services to enjoy all the advantages that smart tourism promises.\n\n\n5.5.2 Impacts on the tourist\nSmart tourism and its components impact the tourist in several ways, including the experience, satisfaction, behavior, and decision-making (Mehraliyev et al., 2020). Smart tourism can enhance the tourist experience by fostering greater engagement and interaction with and between tourists, and promoting the exchange of experiences (Buonincontri & Micera, 2016). For example, today it is easy for tourists to share their travel experience in many different ways: they can post photos and videos of their trip, or write a review to share information with their family and friends on social media. Geocaching is another example that shows how the experiences of younger tourists can be enhanced by diversifying and gamifying the activities they enjoy in a destination (Skinner et al., 2018).\nSmart tourism facilitates tourist planning and decision-making before and during travel, e.g., “smart travel guides” that allow interaction between content and the tourist in a highly dynamic way (Chuang, 2020; Ruíz et al., 2017). By using smart technologies, tourists are less constrained by the arrangements they make before they leave on a trip, as destination information is readily available wherever they are during their trip. Moreover, tourists can obtain relevant information for their trip through websites or mobile applications based on their previous behavior, consumption patterns, and browsing records on the networks and the internet. This allows tourists to adapt their consumption throughout the trip, as their needs change or they discover new information on an on-going basis (Y. Li et al., 2017). The result is that tourists can end up becoming much more unpredictable consumers than before. One consequence of the above is that the efforts made by tourism firms to improve tourist satisfaction (through smart technologies and process reengineering) are increasing day by day, for example, by implementing automatic billing processes in self-service restaurants through the use of neural networks (Aguilar et al., 2018), by installing lighting control systems in hotel rooms to improve the quality of service (Feng et al., 2017), by developing dynamic software tools that allow the characteristics of hotel rooms to be adjusted according to the activities carried out by the customer (Cetina et al., 2013), or by promoting the use of virtual and augmented reality systems to experience tourist attractions in a more enjoyable way.\nLast but not least, another important impact is related to consumer preferences when it comes to adopting smart technologies and smart information. Although this is an area that needs more research, there are some studies that highlight that ease of use and perceived usefulness are key factors influencing consumer attitudes towards smart technologies (Bae et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2015). Other factors, such as informativeness, interactivity, accessibility, and personalization are also highly relevant (Chung & Koo, 2015). In conclusion, it is important that tourism firms are aware of the factors that affect their customers and users when adopting smart tourism, and that they understand how tourists prefer to enjoy tourism experiences (e.g., “more smart”, “less smart”). This is a field of knowledge that will gradually gain in importance and that is very likely to change the way in which tourism firms segment and interact with customers."

    "section": "5.6 Criticism of Smart Tourism",
    "text": "5.6 Criticism of Smart Tourism\nThe tacit consensus reached among most academics, consultants, and leaders from the technology industry reveals an overly optimistic view of the effects of smart tourism, both for tourism firms and tourists. It often happens that many of the benefits that are continually pointed out by industry and academia are poorly supported by empirical data, which advises owners and managers to be cautious in trusting the promised benefits and the ease of obtaining them. This does not mean that owners and managers should distrust smart tourism recommendations by default, but rather that many slogans have been widely criticized due to the lack of studies to support them.\nThe first criticism has to do with the limited empirical evidence that academic and industry research has provided in recent years on the benefits of smart tourism, beyond highly specific case studies. In addition, the little practical research that has been carried out in this respect has provided very limited theoretical advances, which prevents establishing broad generalizations that cover all tourism activities and firms, since they have no validity beyond the isolated case studies investigated.\nA second criticism is that the study on smart tourism has been carried out on very few fronts (e.g., destinations, specific smart technologies, the tourist experience, combined effects with other technologies). This means that there is neither a solid body of empirical evidence nor an elaborate theoretical framework that is exclusive to tourism and on which we can base conclusions about the real impacts that smart tourism has on tourism firms. This lack of understanding about the business perspective of smart tourism means that the answer to the question of how smart tourism actually affects tourism firms, and what factors limit its adoption, remains open.\nThe third criticism relates to the lack of understanding about tourist preferences, as it is still hard to know for sure which aspects of smart tourism are most (or least) preferred by tourists, or which segments of tourists are those most/least likely to choose smart tourism. Ultimately, what owners and managers should note is that there is a general absence of solidly grounded discourse on the impacts and consequences of smart tourism. This leads us to point out the significant limitations that exist in determining the drivers, drawbacks, and costs associated with implementing a smart tourism strategy in the tourism firm. Therefore, business owners and managers should take a critical standpoint, aware that not all the effects of the Smart Revolution are positive for the tourism firm. There is still a long way to go in identifying, measuring, and mitigating the negative effects and drawbacks of smart tourism in real life, and only more and better empirical work will help clarify the pros and cons.\n\n5.6.1 e-Lienation\nOne of the most studied negative aspects of smart tourism is that of e-lienation, which highlights the negative impact that ICTs have on the consumer’s own experience (Tribe & Mkono, 2017). According to these authors, there is sufficient evidence to affirm that the use of smart technologies can promote isolation and addiction on the part of the consumer, as well as self-marginalization, loss of routines, and even the breaking of social ties and misconduct when complying with rules, uses, and customs. These behavioral alterations that can affect the consumer, both in an individual and social context, can even pose a threat to the restorative purpose sought by the tourist with a trip or vacation. Circumstances like this are more frequent than most think and they happen when tourists have a hard time disconnecting from their work obligations and take their computer and mobile devices on a getaway or on vacation, or when they feel obsessed with chatting and sending emails to friends and family at home, or keep tweeting or posting on Facebook and Instagram to show the world their “perfect self in the perfect place”.\nThese behaviors are a reflection of e-lienation and can negatively influence the quest for authenticity of tourist experiences to the point of reinforcing anxiety, narcissism, and addiction. Of course, not all the uses that tourists make of ICT have to end in e-lienation, but it seems evident that the more we use ICT in our leisure and tourism time, the more opportunities arise to suffer from e-lienation (Tribe & Mkono, 2017). Business owners and managers need to be aware of these circumstances and the negativities they can bring to the tourism experience. This means being able to identify the critical factors that can lead to e-lineation before deciding to undertake a transformation strategy that involves the implementation of smart technologies and organizational change."

    "section": "6.1 Defining Digital Transformation",
    "text": "6.1 Defining Digital Transformation\nJust as happened when we defined the terms smart and smart tourism, defining digital transformation is not straightforward. The literature on digital transformation is vast and many authors and organizations have contributed their particular vision of the phenomenon in recent years, generally emphasizing those dimensions that most affected or concerned them. Although it is not within the scope of this chapter to theorize or try to establish a universal definition of what digital transformation is, it is worth stopping for a moment a make clear how the notion of digital transformation has been used in this book, so that we can share a common vocabulary.\nThe term “digital transformation” refers in this book to a process of profound and evolutionary change that affects all aspects of the organization, led by digital capabilities and technologies aimed at creating value. The fact that digital transformation is an evolutionary process indicates that the phenomenon of transformation is continuous; that is, it is maintained over time (Morakanyane et al., 2017). There are some authors, however, who argue that digital transformation involves more radical or disruptive change than simply an evolutionary process. This is a challenging academic discussion that has been going on for a long time in which the author cannot take sides because, in the end, both streams of thought are adequate lenses to tackle digital transformation (Riasanow et al., 2019). The idea of an evolutionary process accurately describes what happens most of the time in the digital transformation of businesses in real life, although it is also true that tourism firms must be prepared for disruptions in their routine activities and business processes when faced with digital transformation (Balaji & Lavanya, 2018).\nDigital technologies play a vital role and are the foundation of digital transformation initiatives. However, digital transformation is not connected to any specific technology (e.g., cloud computing, mobile phones, social media, etc.); nor is it driven by any particular digital innovation. Even those who think that using digital technologies is enough to drive change and achieve transformation are wrong. Organizations fundamentally require a set of new skills, as well as a distinctive mindset and culture, to successfully tackle digital transformation. It is precisely into this set of new capabilities that digital technologies must be incorporated if the organization intends to reap the benefits of digital transformation.\nDigital technologies, coupled with organizational capabilities, can create endless opportunities with the potential to transform tourism firms, especially when they are related to new business models, operating processes, and products and services. In the end, what owners and managers should seek is to create value both for the organization and for customers by generating operational efficiencies, improving the customer experience, reducing costs, improving the relationship with stakeholders, etc. In view of the above, there are three different but closely related dimensions that shape digital transformation (Reis et al., 2018):\n\nThe technological dimension, since digital transformation is based around the use of digital technologies that include infrastructures, networks, devices, as well as the software that makes digital applications possible.\nThe organizational dimension, since digital transformation itself entails a significant change in the organizational processes, and even in the culture and business model of the tourism firm.\nThe social dimension, since digital transformation is a process that affects consumer behavior and beliefs, both individually and in society (i.e., the way tourists consume tourism products and services, the reasons why tourists prefer some channels to others, the way tourists interact with friends and family, or how tourists enjoy a travel experience).\n\nWhen it comes to digital transformation, the mere implementation of digital technologies in the organization is not enough. Rather, digital transformation encompasses far-reaching changes that extend to organizational management, the firm’s operational processes, and its own organizational culture. This large-scale change process affects all members of the organization and their way of relating to the customer, leading to improvements in the firm’s performance and the creation of competitive advantages."

    "section": "6.2 Essentials of Digital Transformation",
    "text": "6.2 Essentials of Digital Transformation\nDigital transformation is a challenging undertaking that takes time to complete and is often more complex than expected. It makes products and services obsolete faster, while encouraging the emergence of new ones that are accessible through a wide variety of channels, such as websites and social applications (Brown & Brown, 2019). Digital transformation redesigns the role of people in business organizations (Bala, 2018), and prompts business leaders to rethink strategy, leadership, and organizational culture (Mahraz et al., 2019).\nThese substantive transformational changes differ from the typical organizational changes of earlier stages in several respects. For example, the technologies involved today, such as Big Data, analytics, artificial intelligence, etc., differ substantially from previous technologies. In addition, the complexity of the environment in which tourism firms operate is much greater than it was before. Digital technologies provide more information, computing, and connectivity capacity than ever, thus enabling new patterns of collaboration between distributed networks of actors that are more diverse. New dependencies also emerge between actors whose interests may not be fully aligned (Vial, 2019). This means that digital transformation is not limited to a specific type of business or industry, or to the implementation of particular ICTs, but also encompasses much larger and more complex ecosystems and has major organizational implications (Högberg, 2021).\nManaging digital transformation requires orchestrating work within the firm to achieve better products/services and build business models that harness the benefits offered by digital technologies. It is thus important that tourism firms consider their own digital transformation very seriously, since those firms that fail to adapt to the digital environment will fall victim to “digital darwinism”. In other words, firms that resist digital transformation will surely end up disappearing and only those that adapt and respond to technological trends will survive and remain in the competitive arena (Schwartz, 2002).\nTourism firms face increasing pressures from customers, competitors, and employees to initiate or accelerate their pace of digital transformation, and constantly redefine their value proposition. Connectivity, automation, new data, and new digital customer interfaces are challenging traditional value chains as we knew them. Therefore, tourism firms need to carefully assess their product and service portfolios, and the skill set they have. This means starting to make progress on their digital maturity (if they haven’t already started) to seize opportunities, develop better offerings, and bring them to market quickly. How and in what direction the firm can take effective steps remains unclear. In the end,everybody seems to agree that digital is better, deeper, and faster (Bala, 2018), but to benefit from digital transformation tourism firms must be able to put together a plan that is coherent and consistent.\nThe accelerated pace in the development of digital technologies and their wide-ranging effects on tourism firms make digital transformation processes so uncertain that it is virtually impossible to predict which businesses will succeed in their transformation. Even so, it is becoming increasingly clear that competitiveness has long since ceased to depend solely on physical products, and now depends more on the integration of organizations in ecosystems of smart technologies and services. The new possibilities offered by digital technologies are ultimately pushing tourism firms to evaluate the potential to innovate their business models and constantly reinvent themselves. Digital transformation is now an inevitable and irreversible process, at full throttle in the economy and in society as you read these lines (Mahraz et al., 2019). But for digital transformation to gain momentum in tourism ecosystems, the heroic efforts of a few firms, however important they may be, are not enough. It is thus essential to organize concerted actions between all actors in the tourism ecosystem and policy makers to achieve a harmonized regulatory framework, powerful communications, fluid information infrastructures, and an environment that encourages investment to give a new impetus to the competitiveness of tourism firms through digital transformation and smartization."

    "section": "6.3 Digitization, Digitalization, and Digital Transformation",
    "text": "6.3 Digitization, Digitalization, and Digital Transformation\nAlthough academics and practitioners generally take it for granted that digital transformation is affecting and challenging business owners and managers in all industries and contexts, the truth is that there is an overwhelming lack of clarity when it comes to understanding it. One of the main challenges is that there is no reconciled definition of the core elements that make up digital transformation. In fact, many studies see digital transformation as entirely different things: for some authors it means only a slight change enabled by technology (e.g., when a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is implemented in a department of a firm); for others it means the impact that technology has in the strategy or business model of an organization; while for others it implies a more profound and evolutionary approach that develops over time (Morakanyane et al., 2017). It is also quite worrying that there are several key terms, such as digitization and digitalization, whose differences are often unclear, and which add even more confusion and ambiguity when owners and managers use them (Bala, 2018; Henriette et al., 2015; Mahraz et al., 2019). Therefore, we are going to pause for a moment along the way to clarify some terminological differences and learn how to distinguish between them.\n\n6.3.1 Digitization\nThe term digitization means the conversion of information from an analog format to a digital one. It is a pure technical process that seeks to convert something that is analog into a binary language (composed of “0s” and “1s”), so that it can be processed by digital information systems (e.g., a computer, a smart phone, etc.) (Castaldi et al., 2018; Mahraz et al., 2019; Pesonen, 2020; Trenkle, 2019; Udovita, 2020). An example of digitization is converting a paper photo to a digital photo to store it on a flash drive, using a scanning process. Digitization involves significant improvements in the use that organizations make of ICT and in guiding technology implementation strategies. This explains why technology adoption models and the criteria used to select ICT tools in a business context, as well as how data can be integrated into information systems, are common themes pertaining to digitization. In the end, digitization is the first and foremost step in advancing digitalization processes and, subsequently, in digital and smart transformation.\n\n\n6.3.2 Digitalization\nDigitalization involves the use of data and digital technologies to optimize or automate management processes in the organization, including those related to the collection and analysis of data itself. Digitalization encompasses change processes that are much deeper than those of digitization, since it involves the use of technologies in a much broader organizational context (Castaldi et al., 2018; OECD, 2020; Trenkle, 2019). The terms computerization and informatization are concepts closely related to the notion of digitalization and are often used as synonyms.\n\n\n6.3.3 Digital transformation\nThe term digital transformation is used by academics and professionals to refer to changes of all kinds that occur in human activity as a result of digitalization. For business firms, it embodies a socio-technological process whereby the application of digitalization is raised to a systemic level within the organization.\nDigital transformation emphasizes aspects related to cultural change, the way in which the organization is managed, the roles of people, as well as the changes that occur in the operating environment as a result of the adoption of digital technologies. In other words, digital transformation implies a strategic change process focused on advancing the systematic digitalization of the firm while keeping the different business strategies in sync with the IT strategy. Therefore, the concept of digital transformation is different from that of digitization and their meanings are not interchangeable (Riasanow et al., 2019; Udovita, 2020).\nMeanwhile, both digitalization and digital transformation make use of digitization and digital innovation with the intention of improving the firm’s products and services (Yoo et al., 2012). This means that, for many authors (including consultants and ICT of digital transformation). Figure 6.1 describes this conceptual journey from digitization to smart transformation."

    "text": "6.4 Components of Digital Transformation\nDigital transformation is essentially made effective through the following four drivers of change supported by enablers and value propositions, as shown in Figure 6.2 (Bala, 2018; Berger, 2015; Castaldi et al., 2018):\n\nDigital data: The capture, processing, and analysis of digital data to make decisions and improve the forecasting capabilities of the firm.\nAutomation: The combination of conventional technologies with artificial intelligence capabilities to enable systems to work autonomously and to be self-organized. Through automation, firms increase the speed of processes, reduce error rates, and reduce operating costs.\nConnectivity: The integration of the firm value network through mobile or fixed broadband telecommunications networks to synchronize the components of the supply chain and shorten both production times and innovation cycles.\nAccess to the digital consumer: The use of the internet to provide direct access to digital consumers, substantially increasing the transparency of markets and choice options.\n\nWithin the framework of digital transformation, digital technologies are key drivers that provide the firm with greater interactivity and the possibility for stakeholders to participate in the creation of new value for the business, in the design of products/services, in the generation and exchange of knowledge, and even in the contribution of new experiences. This requires firms to thoroughly review their business management practices, increasingly determined by the ability to act in the new value networks that emerge from their integration into ecosystems capable of self-learning and self-organization."

    "section": "6.5 Benefits of Digital Transformation",
    "text": "6.5 Benefits of Digital Transformation\nDigital transformation is happening all around us all the time. In fact, there is almost certainly not a single aspect of our lives that has not been affected y it. The effects of digital transformation are considerable and have a lasting impact on firms and economic systems, but also on the lives of individuals and society in general. If there is still someone who needs to be convinced of the importance of digital transformation for their organization, here are some of the most widely accepted benefits (Reddy & Reinartz, 2017).\n\n6.5.1 Interaction costs\nIn all economic systems, including business firms, the interactions that take place in the markets generate costs that are the result of the exchange of information and of products and services. Digital transformation is key to reducing these costs and, therefore, to creating value for organizations, so that the more exchanges that take place, the greater the potential benefits for the firm. Furthermore, as digital transformation makes information more accessible to all, asymmetry between market participants is reduced, thus markets become more fluid and competitive.\n\n\n6.5.2 Information and value exchange\nDigital transformation pushes firms to move from unilateral and bilateral exchange models to one based on networks. In other words, consumers and businesses are evolving from linear chains of exchange (and value creation) to becoming part of networks in which multiple exchanges take place at the same time. In addition, these networks emerge, grow, and vanish constantly. As a result, the number of connections that arise between the actors of the tourism ecosystem is growing exponentially, as well as the speed at which value is created and exchanged between them.\n\n\n6.5.3 Massive amounts of data\nThe ever-increasing computing power and its highly distributed nature around the new value networks lead to the so-called Big Data. Cisco Systems’ predictions suggest that global IP traffic will reach 396 exabytes per month by 2022, up from 122 exabytes per month in 2017. That is 4.8 zettabytes of traffic per year by 2022. In this data-flooded landscape, data can be accessed from everywhere and in real time, leading to a huge number of data handling operations. Therefore, a key challenge for stakeholders in the tourism ecosystem is how to analyze and interpret the patterns that are hidden in huge volumes of data and how to obtain valuable insights to make better informed decisions with them. It should not be a surprise that, in the era of smart transformation, the competitiveness of tourism firms no longer depends on whether they are digital or not, but on whether they are able to learn from their own data (Castaldi et al., 2018).\n\n\n6.5.4 Internationalization\nWith the advent of digital technologies, the role of distance is undermined, as knowledge and intelligence can be generated and distributed on a global scale. This leads to new ways of producing and using knowledge assets, which in turn transforms the role and importance of geographical proximity (Castellani et al., 2017). Local assets, however, do not lose importance immediately, but their role changes since they now have the possibility of integrating into global channels that connect geographically dispersed sources of knowledge. By virtue of digital transformation, an empowerment effect can also be triggered that spurs SMEs to access digital networks and interact with distant counterparties, thus facilitating internationalized business models that extend their presence globally without involving significant amounts of direct investment. The ability of modern firms to access international markets with a smaller asset footprint has led to micro-multinationals and born global firms, which are those that with minimal cross-border investment rapidly achieve global reach (Gestrin & Staudt, 2018).\n\n\n6.5.5 Irreversibility\nDigital transformation is permeating and fundamentally transforming our daily lives, and it is doing so in an irreversible way. The main driver of these changes is the accelerated reduction in the cost of computing. According to Yale Professor William Nordhaus, while the average annual decrease in costs between 1945 and 1980 was 37%, in the 1980s and 1990s these costs decreased at an average annual rate of 64%. In the coming decades, as computing power continues to grow exponentially, the forces driving digital transformation will continue to be highly relevant.\nDigital transformation is expected to drive the creation of more tangible and intangible value for tourism firms in the future. However, it is worth noting that all these benefits also come with often unforeseen costs and risks. Therefore, it is important that the owners and managers of tourism firms have a good understanding of the opportunities that are presented to them, but also of the potential challenges that surround the creation of value in digital environments. We are all going to be affected to one degree or another and no stone will be left unturned.\nAccor and Digital Transformation\nAccor looks to the future of digitalization by focusing on the customer experience and providing value propositions for all stakeholders in the hospitality value network. Increasingly, the hospitality industry is transforming into a digitally enabled end-to-end provider that works with different tools and technological applications that are increasingly powerful and integrated (e.g., mobile, cloud, artificial intelligence, blockchain, Internet of Things, etc). Hotels have the potential to deeply engage with guests at every possible touch point in the customer journey and provide them with new opportunities to create personalized experiences. However, just focusing on the customer is not enough. It is also crucial to reach agreements with other players in the ecosystem that allow hospitality firms to remain competitive and create new revenue streams (e.g., airlines, cruise lines, travel agents, etc.). Another important challenge is ensuring that the organization’s workforce has the right digital skills to manage new customer-centric strategies. In the end, hospitality firms must understand how to apply digital technologies to their daily operations to improve guest satisfaction, employee awareness, and higher collaboration with partners. That is why the three main pillars of Accor’s digital experience are: customers, employees, and partners.\nSource: Own elaboration based on Damnjanović et al. (2020)."

    "section": "6.6 Challenges of Digital Transformation",
    "text": "6.6 Challenges of Digital Transformation\nToo often, when someone from the ICT industry or academia delivers a speech or masterclass on digital transformation, they do so by showing the most optimistic side of the story, that is, ignoring the challenges and pitfalls that are common. However, figures speak for themselves. In 2019 alone, US$1.3 trillion was spent on digital transformation efforts with unsatisfactory rates of return (Tabrizi et al., 2019). What’s more, according to a recent Bain & Company report, only 5% of digital transformation initiatives met or exceeded expectations, 20% produced less than half of expected benefits, and 75% underperformed (Baculard et al., 2017). Despite these disappointing success rates, most firms still believe that the potential payoff of digital transformation is significant and that it can help stay competitive in the marketplace (Gaurav & Kongar, 2021).\nSome of the main challenges involved in the execution of digital transformation are examined below. Although this is not an exhaustive account of all the challenges that may arise, it does reflect how the effects of digital transformation encompass both the organization itself, its resources, and the relationship with the customer (Bala, 2018).\n\n6.6.1 Customer experience\nThe transformation of the customer experience is evidenced through the different ways in which consumers use the products and services of tourism firms, as well as by changes in consumer behavior and loyalty. It is also reflected in the interactive communication that occurs with customers during the sales process and the different digital touchpoints made available between the firm and customers.\nCustomers in the digital environment are extremely demanding and expect firms to listen, understand, and be more flexible regarding changes in their needs. They are already used to using digital technologies in their daily lives and expect to continue to use them in all other facets of life such as when shopping, working, or traveling. This is even more apparent with the new generations known as digital natives, who were born surrounded by technologies and who now demand that their service experiences have a digital dimension. It should therefore come as no surprise that firms that want to build satisfying relationships with customers are forced to rethink the consistency of their digital communication channels and integrate new customer tracking systems, which ultimately requires investing in new infrastructure, processes and skills (Mahraz et al., 2019).\n\n\n6.6.2 Processes and business models\nThe advance of digital transformation challenges firms to transform their main operational and business processes, encouraging them to be more agile and efficient through digital technologies. This includes, for example, the automation of product/service delivery, distribution, and marketing processes (Vial, 2019), the creation of intelligent products and services that incorporate artificial intelligence and allow algorithm-based decision-making, or the ability of workers to perform their functions in different functional areas of the same organization, all of which help to generate cost savings and increase the performance of firms (Mahraz et al., 2019). Furthermore, new business models may emerge by adding digital content to existing products and services, or by creating entirely new digital solutions (Schwertner, 2017).\n\n\n6.6.3 Legacy systems\nOne of the main challenges posed by digital transformation in business firms is to overcome the limitations of their old legacy systems, since they lack the capabilities and functionalities necessary to respond to the demands of the new digital environments. Overcoming this situation is no simple task. Quite often, a portion of the workforce will be very comfortable working with the old legacy systems despite their limitations. In these cases, it is common to find resistance from workers who fear failure, or the negative consequences of the changes derived from the implementation of new digital systems.\n\n\n6.6.4 Change management\nThe lack of an effective change management method is a considerable obstacle to successfully implementing digital transformation initiatives in the firm, which is greater the more complex the organizational environment. Moreover, getting all areas of the organization to agree on a common course of action can certainly be a challenge. This challenge is frequently aggravated not only by the technical difficulty involved in migrating to a new digital environment, but also by the incompatibility that usually exists between the technologies available to each department of the firm. To deal with this situation, it is necessary for firms to develop visionary and committed leadership, capable of mobilizing the critical resources of the organization around plausible and measurable objectives, leadership that is able to partner with IT teams to drive innovation. Unfortunately, it is still very common today to see how leadership models are linked to organizational models that are too hierarchical, which hinders innovation and prevents digital transformation from developing at the speed it should.\n\n\n6.6.5 Commitment to transform\nThere are many occasions when digital transformation initiatives do not have the appropriate level of commitment and leadership from senior management to be carried out successfully. This is one of the key reasons why a large number of digital transformation initiatives do not achieve the expected results. This lack of commitment from senior management can become even more apparent when firms try to move forward from developing digital initiatives to implementing them. Business owners and managers often spend their time talking about the need to innovate in increasingly competitive markets. However, this discourse often ends up turning into a deeply ingrained attitude of resistance to organizational learning and innovation. In other words, very often there is a disconnect between what business leaders say they value and the values they actually display through their actions and behaviors. It is still all too easy to find leaders for whom learning is valuable, but their organizations punish failure for daring to learn and innovate, which means they really don’t want to risk change.\n\n\n6.6.6 Skilled labor\nFor digital transformation to take root in the organization, it is essential to have people who are well trained and prepared to work in a digital environment. This need involves both training in digital business and digital technologies and should be aimed at both junior profiles and senior profiles with greater responsibility in the management of the organization. Furthermore, training programs must be well supported by appropriate investment and a business culture consistent with the challenge (Sestino et al., 2020). At the same time, leaders must find a way to trust those employees who have specific digital transformation skills, so that creativity and innovation can be fueled within the organization. At the end of the day, smart organizations must have a workforce that knows how to adapt to change through an organizational culture that is itself change-oriented and capable of responding to challenges. Organizational culture is very often a determining factor in how quickly firms embrace digital transformation.\n\n\n6.6.7 Infrastructure\nModern infrastructures of hardware, software, networks, connectivity, facilities, etc. hold significant value potential to successfully implement a digital transformation strategy. Given the wide variety of devices and technologies that customers use (e.g., mobile phones, PCs, websites, social networks, wearables, etc.) and the intelligent systems that tourist destinations and competitors are already implementing, new challenges arise for the management of infrastructures in firms. These challenges affect both the availability of digital services and the need for the infrastructure to be flexible enough to facilitate the continual addition of new requirements. To tackle this challenge, tourism firms should react in an agile way to the changing requirements that are presented to them.\n\n\n6.6.8 Financing\nDigital transformation requires significant funding to meet the investment needs in infrastructure, digital tools, innovation, training, and new systems development. Therefore, it is highly recommended that tourism firms have a budget at their disposal with sufficient resources dedicated to the digital transformation program and that they avoid diverting to other types of operational policies within the organization."

    "section": "7.1 What Makes Tourism Unique?",
    "text": "7.1 What Makes Tourism Unique?\nAlthough many of the challenges and opportunities that digital transformation represents for tourism firms are similar to those of other industries, tourism has some particularities that make it unique. The tourism ecosystem is highly fragmented and involves a wide variety of actors that are heterogeneous and cover a broad range of services. It is a sector characterized by the overwhelming presence of SMEs (around 85% of the firms with a relevant role in the provision of tourist services according to the OECD) that coexist with a small group of large companies and especially with micro-enterprises.\nTourism is, by definition, information-intensive, which means that many tourism services are eligible for digitalization and smartization. However, since the average size of tourism firms is small, there is a significant challenge when it comes to integrating technologies and investing in customer relations through digital means. Another peculiarity is that tourism firms operate in a global marketplace, although they deliver locally. Furthermore, they are part of unique tourist destinations, with which they are intimately connected in terms of service delivery and consumer decision-making. The attractiveness and accessibility of destinations is thus a factor that greatly influences the ability of tourism firms to generate business and stay competitive. There are tourism firms that can overcome the role reserved for destinations and attract visitors due to their special service attributes, but the general rule is that the choice of destination is an inherent part of tourist decision-making and influences business. On the other hand, digital tourism firms, i.e., those firms whose business model is totally digital, such as online travel agencies (OTAs) and accommodation platforms, are playing a key role and helping to transform tourism by connecting tourism products and services with customers from anywhere in the world in real time. The good news for tourism SMEs is that they can significantly increase their visibility in the market at relatively low costs. The downside is that many tourism SMEs now depend, at least in part, on large intermediaries who dominate online consumer traffic and impose their business terms often unilaterally.\nThese are not the only challenges facing tourism firms. In addition to the strict conditions imposed by the intermediaries on the platforms, the customers also demand that firms improve the quality of their services (i.e., the best possible service at the lowest possible price) and deliver experiences that always meet their needs. Traditional tourism firms are risk averse and far more concerned with their business survival than with the appetite for innovation and technology. This will have to change drastically if they want to be alive in a few years."

    "section": "7.2 The State of Digitalization in Tourism",
    "text": "7.2 The State of Digitalization in Tourism\nDigitalization represents a major opportunity for tourism firms with the potential to unlock approximately US$1 trillion of value for the industry and society over the next decade (Weinelt & Moavenzadeh, 2017). The World Economic Forum (2017) has estimated that by 2025, digitalization will create up to US$305 billion of additional value only for the tourism sector thanks to higher profitability. It is worth noting that a significant part of this value will be transferred from traditional tourism firms to digital businesses. Digital transformation is also expected to generate US$700 billion in benefits by reducing the environmental footprint, improving safety, and saving time and costs for consumers. Notwithstanding these somewhat optimistic estimates, the reality shows some imbalances between aspirations and achievements. Recent research by the European Commission found significant imbalances in the adoption of digital technologies in tourism across Europe. The geographical location of the firms and their size are factors that could explain these differences; for example, firms located in the Nordic countries show a higher level of acceptance of digital technologies than those located in Eastern and Southern European countries.\nSMEs are also lagging behind large companies (e.g., hotel chains, airlines, big tour operators), especially in those technologies that are more sophisticated or that require greater integration at an organizational or technological level, such as Big Data, analytics, artificial intelligence, or cloud computing (Dredge et al., 2019). According to the European Commission, tourism SMEs are characterized by a low level of digitalization, with most of the technologies they use focused on enabling e-commerce and social media. Furthermore, SMEs fall short in mid- and high-level digitalization technologies, and there is little evidence that major steps are being taken towards the implementation of smart technologies and their interoperability. The European Commission also highlights some political-institutional and policy-making factors that have an impact on the digitalization of tourism firms. For example, the higher the level of education, the greater the access to digital technologies, and the higher the public sector spending, the higher the level of digitalization is reached, as is the case of the Nordic countries, compared to the countries of Eastern Europe (Dredge et al., 2019). Despite this unequal assimilation of digital technologies by tourism SMEs, digital transformation is having and will continue to have a crucial role in transforming tourism, driven by the cumulative nature of technological change, the convergence of technologies, and the progressive price reduction (UNCTAD, 2018).\nThe shift to a digital economy offers great opportunities for tourism firms of all sizes wherever they are. These opportunities translate into access to new markets and knowledge networks, the provision of new tourism services to consumers on a global scale at a relatively low cost, the improvement of competitiveness, and higher performance and improvement of business productivity (OECD, 2017a). However, capturing these benefits will depend on achieving a balanced combination of investment in digital infrastructure, development of human capital skills, and innovation in business models (OECD, 2019). But this is not a rapid or easy task. This balance is key to starting a transition towards the digitalization of tourism SMEs and then continuing to smartization. Unfortunately, in some countries there are still significant gaps between the investment of tourism firms in digital technologies and those made by firms in other sectors."

    "section": "7.3 Drivers of Digitalization in Tourism",
    "text": "7.3 Drivers of Digitalization in Tourism\nThe use of ICTs in the tourism industry has a long tradition that becomes more evident from the year 2000 when many of the repetitive tasks of the tourism business begin to be automated (e.g., buying tickets, booking accommodation, etc.), and electronic commerce emerges strongly introducing new technological capabilities that allow completely new ways of distributing and marketing tourism products and services. Similarly, as consumers become more accustomed to searching, planning, and booking travel online, digital technologies emerge powerfully, driving new advanced capabilities for tourism firms.\nBut what really are the key drivers that motivate tourism firms to make the transition to digitalization? This section summarizes some of the main drivers of digitalization that business owners and managers should be aware of (Fig. 7.1).\n\n7.3.1 Consumer demand\nThe appetite for travel is growing strongly due to the demographic evolution of the population on a global scale. The increasing incorporation of millennials into travel, the expansion of the size of the middle class in the regions with the highest demographic potential, and the general increase in disposable income are making this growth in tourism demand quite robust everywhere. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast sees the total number of travelers reaching 4 billion in 2024, surpassing pre-COVID-19 levels (103% of the 2019 total) (IATA, 2022). A little more time will be needed for international passenger traffic to reach pre-COVID-19 levels, as it will not do so until a year later, in 2025, according to the IATA forecast (Fig. 7.2).\nGrowing demand certainly brings great opportunities, but it also challenges stakeholders in the tourism ecosystem to quickly adapt their strategies to capture growth. For example, tourism firms are increasingly seeking stronger and more stable interactions with their customers, while trying to adapt operations according to the better knowledge they have about customer demands and preferences. Connected wearable devices and artificial intelligence are already providing opportunities to make operations efficient and enable collaboration by sharing knowledge assets between firms. Ultimately, digital technologies are also having an impact on the workforce, allowing employees to have real-time information to speed up decision-making and focus on their strengths (Weinelt & Moavenzadeh, 2017).\n\n\n7.3.2 Benefits perceived by firms\nDredge et al. (2019) provide the following reasons why tourism SMEs perceive significant benefits from digitalization based on their survey of thousands of European SMEs.\n\nGrowth: Two of the top benefits perceived by SMEs include “improving online presence” and “improving growth”. Both are indicators of how tourism firms are confident that digitalization can be instrumental in achieving their growth ambitions.\nFuture opportunities: Tourism SMEs rely on the opportunities that digitalization offers for their businesses. Interestingly, this situation contrasts with the observations made by other studies according to which SMEs lack awareness and knowledge about the opportunities of digitalization.\nCost savings: For many SMEs, digitalization is nothing more than a way to reduce costs and improve access to markets when dealing with fluctuations in demand, such as those caused by seasonality, economic crisis or pandemic.\nInteractivity with the ecosystem: Tourism SMEs also perceive digitalization as a source of opportunities to strengthen connections between the different actors that make up the tourism ecosystem. Through digitalization, tourism SMEs can improve their links with other SMEs, with destinations, with consumers, and with other subsectors (e.g., transport, accommodation, attractions, etc.). This logic also suggests the perception on the part of SMEs that digitalization can help make supply chains more flexible and create new value through participation in expanded digital business ecosystems.\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Personalization of experiences\nWith the rise of the digital consumer and the emerging new trends in tourism, there is a growing demand for tailor-made products and services beyond mass tourism, as consumers expect increasingly personalized solutions that meet their individual habits and preferences (Zsarnoczky, 2018). This phenomenon is more noticeable among younger tourists, who are individualists and seek experiences that respond to their own ideas and preferences.\nThe emergence of individualism creates numerous opportunities, which may explain why a good number of new start-ups in the tourism sector are led by young people. Individualism also leads to customer fragmentation, which in turn leads to market fragmentation. In such a disintegrated market, consumers tend to behave selfishly, paving the way for personalized services and tailored solutions. As a result, tourism firms are driven to optimize the use of the resources at their disposal to provide flexible experiences to customers, which means they must continually collect and exchange data and extract useful insights from it.\nToday, most tourism firms have access to extensive information about their customers and are able to monitor and track consumer behavior and changes in preferences in a cost-effective manner. Moreover, basic capabilities for customizable experiences are available through various tools, such as customer relationship management (CRM) customer databases. For example, cloud-based CRM systems can configure effective value propositions by analyzing past sales records and demographics (Zsarnoczky, 2018). Leading firms in the tourism sector are able to analyze huge datasets and use scalable Big Data analytics methods to search for patterns of behavior. This process of extracting value from data is one of the critical foundations of smartization.\n\n\n7.3.4 Disruptive innovations\nInnovations in tourism manifest in many different ways. Some of the most powerful are the result of disruptive changes in customer behavior and expectations, shifts in the competitive landscape, and the availability of data (Högberg, 2021). Today’s tourists are highly knowledgeable thanks to digital technologies. They can easily move from one digital channel to another (e.g., from hotel websites to OTAs) and between different devices (e.g., from mobile phones to tablets, and to PCs). With the use of digital technologies and mobile devices, hotel guests can manage their reservation and search for information on their smart phones before their arrival at a destination or at their convenience during their stay. Social media technologies, such as mobile phone applications and real-time instant communication, are also part of this new context that enables customers to become co-creators of tourist experiences (Tajeddini et al., 2019). Consequently, the expectations of the guests are greatly affected and become much broader and more demanding.\nThis new panorama of ever-greater and always unsatisfied customer expectations is proving to be an ideal breeding ground for the emergence of new non-traditional players (e.g., Airbnb, Tripadvisor, OTAs such as Expedia, Booking.com, etc.) that compete to establish new alliances with customers through highly differentiated digital ecosystems. Tourism firms become dependent on the one hand, on these platforms that provide them with the visibility to attract customers and the trust to generate new leads (i.e., through their pricing policy, reviews made by other guests); on the other hand, firms compete with the platforms themselves in attracting customers and avoiding the intermediation commissions that they charge for each reservation made through the platform. The engagement of tourism firms in digital platforms has drastically altered the power relationship between firms and their customers, as firms now have much more information available about their customers than ever before, allowing them to act in a more informed and accurate way.\nFurthermore, some of the predictions made about the future of product development strategies in various industries indicate that within a short period of time almost all of our everyday objects and equipment will be accessible via the internet. The devices of the future, unlike the devices of today, will communicate bidirectionally, providing the user experience with new capabilities linked to personalized differentiation and autonomy of decision. New emerging demands for continuous real-time connectivity will mean continuous data collection while using smart devices. Eventually, all relevant information will combine together into a centralized real-time data and service management system known as the Internet of Things (IoT), which will provide robust and secure data handling for all connected devices (Zsarnoczky, 2018). However, a major problem is that firms need Big Data and artificial intelligence-based computing solutions to store, manage, and organize all this enormous amount of information, and these new innovations affect the speed, efficiency, and current computing capabilities of most firms to deliver consistent tourism experiences.\n\n\n7.3.5 State intervention\nStates intervene in the tourism ecosystem through policies of different scope at the national, regional, and local level with the aim of accelerating the adoption of digital technologies. These policies are conditioned by a wide variety of factors, including the business structure of the ecosystem, the political and institutional context, the legal framework, the geospatial conditions, the social and demographic characteristics, the climate of confidence for investment, the competitive environment, etc. (Dredge et al., 2019). These influences manifest themselves with different degrees of intensity in the different states and in the components of the tourism ecosystem, leading to digitalization processes at different speeds. The way states design and implement their digitalization policies affects the likelihood that tourism firms will embrace digitalization, so it is important that states consider the aforementioned factors to improve their success rate in digital initiatives.\n\n\n7.3.6 Safety and security\nAs digital acquires a more relevant role in the management of tourism firms, a greater collaborative effort to promote cybersecurity and protect the privacy of tourist data becomes imperative (Weinelt & Moavenzadeh, 2017). Security concerns are relevant both for physical environments (e.g., airport controls, city mobility systems, hotel facilities)) and for digital environments (e.g., data privacy, veracity of electronic transactions). Security breaches and accidents, whether in the physical or digital realm, can lead to severe financial and reputational damage to tourism firms. Similar risks exist when geopolitical tensions or terrorist activity occur, all of which fuels an unprecedented interest in safety and security. The real challenge for tourism stakeholders today is how to support the growing demand for seamless tourism experiences, while improving safety standards. As tourism firms continue to move down the digital path, security and cybersecurity-focused digital technologies (e.g., biometrics, crowd analytics, artificial intelligence applied to video monitoring, etc.) will continue to evolve to create a safe and secure ubiquitous environment. After all, higher levels of cybersecurity are critical to maintaining customer trust and public safety."

    "section": "7.4 Opportunities of Digitalization",
    "text": "7.4 Opportunities of Digitalization\nDigital technologies are bringing substantial transformations to the tourism business, revolutionizing tourism firms, business ecosystems, consumers and destinations. Digitalization is changing the traditional roles of tourism firms and consumers, giving rise to new relationship models between them and changing the way institutions manage tourism public policies. The spread of smart devices has transformed the way tourism firms manage their operations and has opened up new horizons for innovation in sales and marketing throughout the tourism industry. As a result, new business models are emerging, many of them driven by new digital platforms that build alliances and link the objectives of stakeholders in the tourism ecosystem, increasing the quantity and variety of products, services, and experiences.\nIn the digital era, digital platforms become new sources of value creation, since they allow expanding connections with many external actors and facilitate innovation from abroad. This becomes key for tourism firms to remain relevant in the digital economy. Nonetheless, there are tradeoffs. The emergence of the digital platforms is also aggravating the fragmentation of the tourism market, and the competition between traditional and non-traditional competitors is intensifying, not to mention that tourism SMEs are very often subject to harsh commercial conditions imposed by the platforms given the control of the market they have. All these changes are creating many opportunities, as well as challenges, for tourism firms, the customer and society in general. Figure 7.3 shows a comparison between the market capitalization of OTAs and that of traditional players in the tourism industry, which justifies the true dimension of this phenomenon.\nTourism firms can fundamentally benefit at the operational level through lower unit costs thanks to improvements in the efficiency of customer relationship processes and a higher volume of demand generated by personalized products and services and better experiences provided. Intelligent automation (e.g., artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, robotics) is making it possible for tourism firms to produce products and services at reduced cost and with a smaller environmental footprint. Powered by smart technologies, the next wave of solutions will collect massive amounts of data from all kinds of systems across multiple touchpoints between customers and tourism service providers. By combining data, people, and things, the customer experience will be transformed, leading to an increased likelihood of new bookings.\nThe benefits for customers are also apparent, such as the opportunity to enjoy seamless experiences tailored to individual preferences and demands across the entire tourism ecosystem. However, the extent to which customers realize these benefits will depend on their willingness to provide data to tourism service providers.\nOn a societal level, digitalization can help generate higher income for those participating in the sharing economy using their own assets (e.g., houses, vehicles, bicycles, etc.), as well as contribute to a lower environmental impact through improvements in the efficiency of production processes and the optimized use of assets involved in tourism experiences (Weinelt & Moavenzadeh, 2017). Now that digital technologies have become more affordable and portable, there are no longer barriers preventing people and things from connecting. Digital trust has become a cornerstone of the tourism industry, since without digital trust firms cannot use and share the data that enhance their operations. Fortunately, tourism consumers are likely to share more information when they feel it is necessary for safety reasons or when they are looking for more personalized experiences.\nVery often tourism SMEs perceive the opportunities of digitalization as short-term market-focused advantage. This is far from recognizing the potential that digitalization has for innovation and the development of new products and services, or for building a more efficient ecosystem. Less digitally mature SMEs are often more interested in digital technologies as tools that can help them improve service quality, increase customer retention and streamline processes, while SMEs with a medium level of digitalization are looking more for ways to expand their commercial reach internationally (Dredge et al., 2019).\nMoreover, the particularities of digitalization in tourism SMEs still need to be nuanced when we look at the different subsectors of tourism. For example, in the accommodation subsector, SMEs with a lower level of digitalization are more concerned about the international outreach of their operations, perhaps due to the important role that online booking and accommodation sharing platforms play in it. On the other hand, more mature SMEs prefer that digitalization facilitates the entry of new intermediaries into the market, thus increasing the opportunities to create new value through the expansion of the tourism ecosystem. In contrast, in the travel subsector, less mature SMEs are more interested in using digitalization to generate profitability and acquire customer insights. All in all, digitalization provides a vast range of opportunities that are multidirectional and that can help tourism firms create new sources of value, both inside and outside of tourism."

We have just seen in the previous section how the tourism ecosystem is fragmented into several subsectors (e.g., transport, accommodation, restaurants, personal services, etc.), which in turn are subject to different challenges (and opportunities) in terms of digitalization. Each subsector has its own particularities in human resources, digital skills and abilities, different levels of access to resources (financial and non-financial), and different levels of awareness. These differences in turn are magnified or attenuated according to the particularities of the ecosystem and the destination in which firms operate. Weinelt and Moavenzadeh (2017) have identified the following five challenges that digital transformation is expected to have for tourism.\n\nRegulation: Regulation has a significant impact on the speed of digital transformation and can either be a great enabler of transformation or pose serious obstacles. In some cases, regulatory regimes may deter tourism firms from implementing new technologies because they are unable to capitalize on them. It is also quite common for innovation to advance at a faster rate than regulation and supporting policies, urging institutions to formulate new regulations for new technological developments.\nInfrastructure: As digital business models gain more and more prominence, physical assets are beginning to lose the central role they used to have. This means that tourism firms must pay more attention to the quality and level of service provided by their digital assets and the investments they make in digital infrastructures (without neglecting their physical assets, which will continue to be important). The costs of implementing new digital technologies are a major concern, especially if we compare SMEs with more limited financial resources and large enterprises. Furthermore, SMEs located in urban settings benefit from modern fiber broadband and wireless connections, while in more remote or rural areas the infrastructure is usually underprovided.\nLegacy systems: Non-digital native firms pursuing digital transformation need their legacy systems to continue operating for some time while new systems are developed and implemented. Transitioning from old to new systems reduces the organization’s agility to transform quickly, so finding a way to manage the process of transformation with different speeds in mind is one way to curb the negative impact of this challenge.\nJobs and skills: Digital transformation requires a skill set that differs from what workers have today. This represents a great challenge for tourism firms and society in general, as it suggests a hard transition for one in every 11 jobs worldwide by 2025. Digitalization is also transforming the tourism ecosystem by creating new types of jobs. Addressing this challenge requires a concerted effort among tourism leaders, government, educational institutions, and civil society to reskill and upskill human capital, thereby mitigating digitalization potential negative impacts.\nDemographics: Demographic trends have an important influence on the speed of adoption of digital technologies and on the world tourism market. Although the growing middle classes of Asia and Latin America will lead the growth of travel worldwide in the coming decades, technology adoption will continue to be led by markets in developed countries rather than those in emerging countries.\n\nIt is important that owners and managers consider digitalization as a means to improve the customer experience, but never to complicate it. In other words, tourism firms should make digitalization work seamlessly and transparently for the customer, without bothering them or requiring them to go the extra mile (Seigneur, 2018). Otherwise, digitalization can easily become a barrier that the customer rejects.\nDigitalization should also seek to increase the income level of local communities in destinations, thus capturing a part of the value that is appropriated by GAFA companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) and the big digital platforms (e.g., Booking.com, Tripadvisor, etc.) through their service fees. In this vein, the implementation of smart technologies in destinations and local firms that are based on the Internet of Things could create new data lakes beyond the scope of GAFA companies and lead to new ways of capturing value that can be transferred from the giants to the locals.\nOther key challenges facing tourism SMEs include difficulties in accessing financial resources, the high costs of training and high-speed broadband connectivity, the availability of technology and skilled human resources, and the rapid pace of technological change, thus making technology investments obsolete very quickly. In addition to these “tangible” challenges, there are other “intangible” challenges, such as those related to corporate culture that lead to a lack of understanding of digital opportunities and to considering the current levels of digitalization sufficient and questioning the strategies that are most suitable for transformation in the short and long term (Dredge et al., 2019).\nSome of the main challenges outlined above reflect a conspicuous lack of understanding of digitalization, its opportunities and challenges by tourism SMEs. This is a major constraint that prevents firms from making informed decisions and acting decisively in the face of changing customer needs and threats from new market entrants, limiting themselves to being reactive in their responses and missing opportunities that arise."

    "section": "8.1 The Value of Data",
    "text": "8.1 The Value of Data\nThe transformation of traditional tourism firms into data-driven organizations mainly affects the organizational processes of the organization, the allocation of internal and external resources, and even the long-standing customs and culture of the people. Ultimately, these transformational changes aim to make the business more agile and responsive to customer demands, that is, more customer-oriented in every way.\nSmart technologies can provide a major boost to the transformational effort of tourism firms if supported by proven standards embedded in technology platforms and everyday data-driven tools (e.g., tools and platforms that automate data storage, classification, and analysis). Furthermore, new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, real-time customer intelligence, analytics for prediction and personalization of services, to name a few, are already key to creating value and driving major changes throughout the tourism ecosystem.\nBut what exactly is “data” and why is it so valuable? Data is a collection of observations, measurements, facts, or even raw representations of phenomena that are not organized in any particular way and do not contain any apparent meaning. Data is the basic unit used to register events, activities, operations, or transactions. Data differs from typical organizational resources as it enables replicable services at almost zero marginal cost. It also provides great flexibility of use regardless of the device it runs on (Veit et al., 2014). However, data alone is useless unless it can be interpreted and made meaningful, and to make this possible, organizations must integrate data with analytics technologies. Data analysis thus activates a process of transforming the value of the data by which data pass through three different value states: “raw data”, “information”, and “knowledge” (Fig. 8.1). This is a sequential process where raw data is first collected, organized, and transformed into a stream of interpreted data called information, and subsequently transformed into usable knowledge through intellectual operations that provide more value to information (Monino, 2021). Through data analytics, organizations have the potential to harness data to uncover previously unseen market insights and business opportunities.\nTourism firms have used data, even big data sets, for a long time, and they have a natural tendency to store all kinds of data. What distinguishes the present moment from any previous one is the ability that firms now have to combine these vast amounts of data with innovative manipulation and knowledge generation techniques (e.g., Big Data, analytics, artificial intelligence, etc.) and consequently boost innovation and business performance (Tsaih & Hsu, 2018). Forecasts predict that the amount of data stored worldwide will increase fivefold, from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to 175 zettabytes in 2025 (Reinsel et al., 2018). The aftermath is a market for Big Data technology that is projected to grow from US$41.3 billion to US$116.1 billion in 2027 (Fortune Business Insights, 2020). Both are clear indicators that show tourism firms how the economic value of data is a key factor that cannot be ignored and that firms are experiencing an unequivocal transition from an economy based on tangible assets to one based on intangibles (Mihet & Philippon, 2018). Tourism firms should therefore not delay in adopting this process of change and start integrating data into all new and existing processes."

    "section": "8.2 Fundamentals of Data-Driven Organizations",
    "text": "8.2 Fundamentals of Data-Driven Organizations\nA data-driven organization is one whose decision-making relies on data from a combination of sources in order to gain competitive advantage and create value (Berntsson Svensson & Taghavianfar, 2020). The three main components of a data-driven organization are as follows (Kiron, 2017).\n\nA high-quality, well-governed database.\nA culture where data is viewed (and treated) as a key organizational asset and continuously analyzed in search of insights that inform business strategy, new business value offerings, and increase customer and employee engagement.\nData-driven capabilities that enable the use of analytics to support decisionmaking and strengthen the business model.\n\nOne good reason to become a data-driven organization is the need to do something with the constant influx of data generated by mobile phones, information systems, machines, the Internet of Things, and all kinds of applications. But also because of the constant requests from many owners and managers to be able to make decisions based on evidence that, ultimately, improve strategies and the effectiveness of actions (Hume & West, 2020).\nIn theory, a data-driven organization can use data for all types of decisions (e.g., strategic, tactical, operational) and for all types of analysis (e.g., descriptive, predictive, prescriptive). In practice, organizations use a combination of types of analysis and decisions based on their goals and the sort of value they expect from each decision. A good handful of organizations have already begun to use data in a highly systematic and calculated way to address strategic challenges and react to, and even anticipate, changes in the marketplace. What these organizations have in common is that they view data as a critical asset.\nTo create value from data, it is not enough that the right person receives the right information at the right moment. The information must also be relevant to the person making the decision. The problem is that in an age of information overload like ours, the ability to discern the correct information is undermined. Most decisions in tourism firms are still made based on the experiences, opinions, and intuitions (or a combination of them) of different stakeholders. Moreover, many decisions about which products or service to innovate, with which partners to ally, or how much to invest in a new market are influenced by politics and individual agendas rather than by the true value expected for the organization or for the customer. Even when data is available, too much information or lack of relevance of the data can puzzle the decision maker and ruin decisions (Berntsson Svensson & Taghavianfar, 2020).\nIn organizations where managers are used to making decisions based on their own experience and intuition, it is normal to think that they do so because they are the most appropriate people given their qualifications and the relevance of the information they possess. However, in data-driven organizations, business leaders are convinced that data analytics can help their organization improve its competitive edge and are therefore willing to use data systematically to support decisionmaking. Data analytics is not only used to prepare reports or make operational or tactical decisions, but to decide on key issues such as budget allocation, the creation of new products and services, and even the business model (Kiron, 2017). Furthermore, leaders pay close attention to the quality of data collection, data processing, and analysis techniques, aware that the quality of their decisions depends heavily on the quality of data sources and visualizations, as well as their ability to interpret the processed data (Berntsson Svensson et al., 2019).\nAll the above could lead business owners and managers to think that in the data-driven organization there is no place for experience or intuition, but the truth is that data cannot replace experience, nor experience data. The way data is created, processed, and analyzed is the result of many individual decisions that introduce personal biases. Data-driven evidence will continue to be weighted with experience, and as analytics becomes a more widespread tool for creating value for organizations, experience will continue to play an important role in determining what value can be extracted from data."

    "text": "8.3 Key Elements of the Data-Driven Organization\nAlthough the potential benefits to be gained from data are huge, the number of tourism firms using data to successfully transform into data-driven organizations remains very low. Smart tourism firms are data-driven organization which rely on the efficient management of their data assets. For smart firms, data management and analytics become decisive success factors in developing the ability to create, acquire, classify, and generate knowledge, as well as apply it where it can create value and generate competitive advantage. However, there is a conspicuous lack of information on how an organization can manage to transform itself into a smart (data-driven) organization and what are the key elements to consider when transitioning towards a data-driven business model (Ghorbani et al., 2019). Some recent studies have tried to synthesize the highlevel dimensions that describe an organization based on data, which are these five (Fig. 8.2) (Hupperz et al., 2021).\n\n8.3.1 Digital transformation and data-driven culture\nFor new and existing processes in the organization to integrate data and take a step forward in smartization, it is necessary that the organization has adopted a digital transformation strategy. This requires that the organization has established a clear action plan that specifies the goals and stages to be followed for an effective transition from the current situation to one based on data. Formulating a digital transformation strategy is always challenging, but implementing the strategy is even more so, as time and resource constraints play a crucial role. The most effective way to succeed, though not always the fastest and easiest, is to build a data-driven culture that creates employee awareness of the vision and strategy to follow, and to integrate the organization into an ecosystem where the firm can engage with other stakeholders to address challenges in an open and innovative way.\n\n\n8.3.2 Data science and analytics\nData science brings together advanced knowledge and techniques to analyze and extract value from data. In essence, data science can add value to the organization by bringing greater transparency to firm processes and decisions, uncovering new needs, and identifying new opportunities to innovate. It can also enable more efficient management of the firm’s resources and operations given its ability to make connections between various factors and predict what might happen. This requires the firm to have professionals with the knowledge and skills necessary to produce useful and enlightening insights for the business, which is a preliminary step for the organization to create competitive advantages.\nData analytics is the set of knowledge, techniques, and tools that drive the generation of business insights and the creation of value through data for the organization. It can be classified into the following three categories, which we will examine in more detail in Chapter 11 of this book (Berndtsson et al., 2018).\n\nDescriptive analytics: collects and generates data through data repositories to explain what happened in the past.\nPredictive analytics: uses data mining techniques (e.g., classification, clustering, association) to find patterns in data that were previously unknown to predict what is going to happen.\nPrescriptive analytics: analyzes both descriptive and predictive business information (e.g., data on customers, sales forecasts, etc.) to help decide what can be done.\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Data-driven business model\nTo create true economic value for the firm and its stakeholders, the business insights produced by analytics must be transferred to the firm’s business model. There are many possible ways to develop a data-driven business model, but perhaps one of the most compelling is to pay close attention to market demand and figure out how the organization is going to discover, create, and capture value, especially from its key resource: digital data. With that purpose in mind, organizations must focus on their core informational resources and capabilities, integrate processes and technologies to explore and exploit their data resources, and measure the value created and captured. In addition, organizations must continue to fine-tune the business model using internal and external operational data to ensure that it will continue to generate value in the future.\n\n\n8.3.4 Data-driven innovation\nData-driven organizations generate and collect vast amounts of data that should not only be used to transform business activities and make them more efficient, but also to innovate. To use data for innovation purposes, organizations need to constantly discover data, analyze it, and try to predict and optimize future events using algorithms. Once new business insights have been generated through the exploration and exploitation of data, the organization must have mechanisms to distribute all this information and knowledge to the different departments of the firm so that they can start creating value from them. The new capabilities that data brings to organizational innovation make research and development activities increasingly relevant to discovering business opportunities that might not otherwise be realized."

    "text": "8.4 Benefits\nSome studies on non-data-driven organizations have come to identify as many as 23 potential benefits of migrating to a data-driven organizational model. The more data-driven an organization is, the more productive it becomes, specifically up to 5% more productive and 6% more profitable compared to the competition (McAfee et al., 2012). Berntsson Svensson & Taghavianfar (2020) have grouped these benefits into the following six categories.\n\nDecisions\nUnderstanding the customer and user\nCreativity and innovation\nProductivity\nMarket position\nGrowth opportunities.\n\nAmong the above benefits, the most relevant for the study participants were those related to decisions, customer/user understanding, and productivity. According to firms, organizational decisions improve significantly as a result of a more data-driven approach, and decisions become more accurate by combining internal data with external data (e.g., competitor data with market trends and sales). In addition, for some firms, decision-making also becomes faster and, therefore, they can react much sooner to changes in their environment.\nAnother key benefit noted by firms is improved customer satisfaction, as the data-driven organization develops insights that enable it to offer customers the products and services they need. In this way, firms can better understand customer/user behavior and where customer churn occurs. Improved productivity is another potential benefit identified by firms. Data-driven organizations can increase efficiency in product and service development and reduce time to market. Furthermore, because data processing enables automated operations, it’s easier to identify problems, provide faster solutions, and get more done with fewer people."

    "section": "8.5 Challenges and Enablers",
    "text": "8.5 Challenges and Enablers\nSome field studies have attempted to explain in recent years the main challenges that organizations face in their journey to become data-driven. For example, in a survey of over 3000 business executives, LaValle and colleagues reported that organizations have more data today than they can use effectively, and that organizational leaders want more computational power and analytics to exploit their growing data and become smarter. In other words, business leadersare willing to run their organizations on data-driven decisions (LaValle et al., 2011). They want to be able to simulate scenarios that provide advance guidance on what are the best actions to take when unexpected or disruptive events occur (e.g., unexpected competitors, earthquakes, pandemics). In the end, what owners and managers demand are ways to understand the optimal course of action to take, based on complex business parameters and scant information. For these expectations to be met, a lesson must be learned that the information generated through data analytics must be aligned with the business strategy.\nOrganizations should not collect data and analyze something simply because it is easy to do. They need to determine what their goals are and what kinds of questions need to be answered beforehand. In addition, the answers must be easy for end users to understand and make them available when needed. Ultimately, the above requires that knowledge be instilled in everything the organization does (i.e., development of new products and services, hiring of new staff, financing decisions, etc.).\n\n8.5.1 Challenges\nRealizing that data-driven opportunities are critical to business growth, many business owners and managers are looking for the best place to start. However, often that entry point is elusive and the challenges too daunting. All in all, the firm must address three main challenges from the outset, regardless of whether everything else has been handled correctly (Berntsson Svensson & Taghavianfar, 2020):\n\nData vs. Intuition: Many organizations on the path to becoming data-driven struggle to figure out how to move from subjective decisions based on intuition, experience, and opinion, to data-driven decisions. Owners and managers must be aware that organizations do not make this transition overnight but go through a maturation process in which intuition and feelings gradually lose weight in decisions. Contrary to popular belief, the ultimate goal is not to suppress opinion-based decisions, but rather to strike a balance between data and intuition that minimizes errors and inaccuracies in decision-making and focuses on value creation for the business.\nTrust: When the organization decides to focus on data, trust in the quality of the data and the insights gained from data processing is of paramount importance to decision makers. Without being sure that the data is reliable and relevant, and that the findings are interpretable and make sense, decision makers are likely to ignore the data or simply be unwilling to implement data-driven decision-making.\nCulture: It is critical to transforming into a data-driven organization. Indeed, all organizational changes to becoming data-driven should be accompanied by an organizational culture aligned with those higher goals. Creating a data-driven culture is a process that cuts across all functions within the organization. It is never an easy job, and much less in organizations that are not very agile and have deep-rooted hierarchical leadership styles, as in data-driven organizations culture means that people are open to sharing data, are aware that data is a critical asset, and they understand why they do this.\n\nOther authors have identified even more challenges to becoming data-driven, such as difficulty accessing reliable and relevant data, lack of a strategy, lack of adoption and understanding by middle management, insufficient organizational alignment, and employee resistance. Addressing the challenges posed by the data-driven model can also vary significantly by business type and size, as well by the type of activities (e.g., transport, accommodation, personal services). It also depends on the access to data sources, digital technologies available, financial resources, and qualified personnel. Other factors that may moderately affect progress towards a data-driven business include the location of the firm and the maturity of the tourism ecosystem and/or the destination in which the business operates, as well as leadership skills, which determine the way in which owners and managers perceive the opportunities in their environment and struggle to benefit from them.\n\n\n8.5.2 Enablers\nAmong the key enablers driving the transition to a data-driven organization, technology features prominently. As an example, data-driven and analytics-driven organizational transformation simply would not be possible without powerful computing power that is easily accessible and affordable (e.g., the internet, communication networks, and resourceful software and algorithms) (Kiron, 2017). Moreover, the interconnection between Big Data, analytics, the Internet of Things, information technology systems, and knowledge management practices is crucial in the data-driven environment, as is the role of artificial intelligence and cloud computing (Fletcher et al., 2020).\nFortunately, data-driven solutions and computational processing power are becoming more widely available to tourism SMEs through cloud computing, which democratizes access to platforms, infrastructure, and software (Samara et al., 2020). For example, small family-run hotels can store customer data in the cloud and make use of data-driven infrastructure and applications that would otherwise only be affordable for large hotel chains. Paradoxically, while these new technologies expand the pool of data that can support knowledge production and decision-making, they generate more and more insights that are increasingly difficult to interpret and understand by decision makers (Kaivo-Oja et al., 2015). This highlights that while data, knowledge management, and smart technologies are going to be key in the coming years, it is equally true that business managers are entering a new era of information saturation that they had better start learning how to govern.\nBeing able to accommodate all these new powerful techniques and tools in the tourism firm makes it essential to gather reliable data. If the organization does not obtain clean and reliable data, all analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques are worth nothing. The firm would find itself in a scenario of the type “garbage goes in and garbage goes out”. When data is unreliable, erroneous, or incomplete, this leads to bottlenecks in data processing and, ultimately, to failures in service with unfavorable consequences for the competitive performance of the organization. Yet this problem is not solved by removing empty spaces in data or fixing incorrect characters in datasets. This requires having a strong data governance practice in place, i.e., data must start to be treated as a core organizational asset of the firm as a preliminary step to gain a deep understanding of the relationships that exist between data, users, and organizational activities. Organizations must also develop a common vocabulary for data (Kiron, 2017) and appoint owners of various types of information (e.g., Chief Data Officers) who are responsible for creating reliable data and ensuring its accuracy. These data managers must take inventory of available data and determine how it should be collected. If the data does not exist, they will need to find alternative ways to collect it or access external data directly (Hume & West, 2020). The big question at this point is whether all tourism firms have the will and the resources to make those kinds of commitments.\nNobody doubts today that the role played by technology is fundamental; however, this is only part of the story. People are equally important, from leaders mobilizing the organization to embark on the Big Data and analytics journey, to front-line employees changing roles and responsibilities, to data scientists and IT engineers who collect and process a huge amount of information. Data-driven organizations need people with excellent analytical skills, the ability to manipulate and understand large data sets, and with the competences to interpret and apply the results. Without people who know what to do with data and how to leverage it, organizations cannot keep moving toward smartness.\nFurthermore, people and technology need to be supported by management processes that guide the entire organization through the different stages that go from data collection to knowledge generation and dissemination. Without them, it simply won’t be possible to make any noticeable progress. Many firms struggle to manage the information they have, even after they have collected, organized, and processed it. This is often due to a lack of robust processes to ensure the relevance, accuracy, and timeliness of information, which explains why so many data-driven initiatives fall short of expectations (Kiron, 2017).\nOne of the few antidotes that organizations can rely on to overcome these threats is leadership. The organization’s leaders must be able to integrate data into decision-making with a blend of awareness, patience, expertise, and precise mobilization of resources and manpower. Leadership must focus not only on using data to improve the existing organization, but also on improving the customer experience; perform better operational processes; and design and implement new data-driven business models. Altogether, the harmonious combination of quality data and knowledge, people, technologies, and processes should lead tourism organizations to be more resilient. Resilience is a key feature of the smart organization that is not achieved by chance or accident, but through smart actions that stem from smart decisions made by smart leaders."
