    "text": "Tourism business owners and managers are at a critical tipping point. The business environment in which they operate has not only become intrinsically more competitive and complex but keeping up with innovation and disruption, while still managing day-to-day operations effectively and efficiently, has become a real challenge. With the advent of the 21st century, people and organizations have realized that we all live in an increasingly VUCA world, an acronym that all tourism professionals should be familiar with and that describes the increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world in which we live. Scholars and professionals now accept that firms are dynamic in nature, that change can happen at any time and come from anywhere, and that we have lost the ability to predict what is going to happen next in business and in our lives. Furthermore, the speed at which change occurs is so high that it is extremely difficult to make the right decision about the direction that our organizations should take. In this context, the unexpected is king and the rules that govern how firms operate are unequivocally different.\nThere are many reasons that can help us understand how we have arrived at this stage, including globalization, digitalization, geopolitical balances, as well as countless social and economic interconnections that operate at the macro and micro levels. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is still a key factor that is driving tourism firms towards this new era of rapid and accelerating change: technology. Advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) are raising consumer expectations and disrupting tourism ecosystems at a breakneck pace, to the point where a new generation of non-traditional data- and technology-focused competitors are driving a radical transformation of tourism. Technology is now embedded in the things we normally see and touch, but also in the things we don’t perceive (e.g., factory production lines, supply and delivery chains, etc.) having become ubiquitous. In fact, many analysts believe that we are already immersed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a new era characterized by cyber-physical systems that are creating radical breakthroughs in various fields of society at an extraordinary fast speed (Schwab, 2017).\nToday, everyone carries a smartphone in their pocket, is in constant communication with their friends, family, and co-workers in real time, and may even live in a house or drive a car that is “intelligent” (Kaivo-Oja et al., 2015). Consumer use of social media has reached unimaginable levels with the support of personal mobile and connected technologies, shaping the way people communicate with each other and with firms. The power of networks and crowds has increased substantially relative to major market leaders, causing changes in people’s social behavior, which, in turn, contain the seeds of a new system of values and beliefs. All these changes are even more noticeable in generations of people who were born between the 1980s and mid-1990s, the so-called Generation Y, whose communication and work habits have forever changed the way they interact with firms and how they make decisions (Burchardt & Maisch, 2019).\nThe impact of all these developments for tourism small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is materializing in a hyper-competitive business environment in which competitive advantages are only temporary (D’Aveni et al., 2010). Organizations need to constantly innovate to stay ahead of the competition and make a profit that vanishes all too quickly (Mariani et al., 2016). Even more worrying is that owners and managers can only expect these changes to continue to intensify further in the future as internet penetration consolidates and the entire population ends up connected via smart devices and highspeed broadband. Driven by these transformative conditions, digital and smart technologies are pushing tourism SMEs in new and somewhat unpredictable directions, providing unprecedented opportunities to develop new markets, develop new tourism products and services, and improve their competitive edge. No doubt these powerful trends towards accelerating change, technology adoption, and growing interconnectedness are fundamentally redefining the preferences and needs of the so-called “new tourist” (Pasca et al., 2021). The “new tourist” favors the use of mobile technologies and digital platforms, is much more informed, knowledgeable, and connected than ever, extraordinarily demanding, and expects services to be provided when and how she wants them, not how tourism firms want them to be (Zine et al., 2014).\nHowever, it is not all good news. Along with the new opportunities and promised big benefits, there are new risks and threats on the horizon for tourism firms. Smart technologies can create an uneven playing field in the business ecosystem, exacerbated by a widening gap between globally connected, data- and technology-driven tourism firms, and traditional micro and small firms whose business models are grounded in the low use and low investment in technology. This disparity is further accentuated as the world’s most innovative and highestvalue digital companies (e.g., Airbnb, Booking, HomeAway, Uber, etc.) coexist with the larger number of traditional tourism SMEs still struggling to understand the opportunities and reap the benefits of digitalization (OECD, 2019).\nFurthermore, reality is much more complex than anybody imagines, and business owners and managers should not consider technology as the only transformative factor that is pushing change hard. Although much of the attention of tourism leaders to date has focused on figuring out how to implement digital technologies, deciding which technology is best, or developing the skills needed to excel in the digital world, time has shown that technology is less effective in improving productivity and driving innovation in an increasingly global and competitive market. Owners and managers should be aware that people are just as important as technology. The leaders who mobilize their organizations to embrace change and provide innovative and effective responses to challenges, and the frontline employees who do their best to satisfy their demanding customers, are essential parts of the smart transformation puzzle.\nThis is the new normal. A time of profound and transformative change that no tourism firm can escape, no matter its size, location, or sector. All tourism firms are affected equally and strongly. So, you may be wondering right now, how can my business fully grasp the true dimension of the Smart Revolution and what it needs to do to address it effectively, given the myriad challenges it faces? This is exactly what this book is about. In it, owners and managers will find a support guide to understand the phenomenon and the true dimension of the Smart Revolution that tourism firms must tackle and will learn how to navigate these turbulent times by transforming the organization in the most effective and efficient way possible.\nLet me welcome you to this wonderful journey and make yourself comfortable. I hope that by reading this book you will discover a better future for yourself and for everyone in your organization.\nSee Knuth (1984) for additional discussion of literate programming.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.

    "text": "Tourism firms, like many in other industries, are not immune to digital disruptions and the deep structural and behavioral changes that digitalization is bringing about in the business ecosystem and in consumers. These disruptions manifest themselves in many different ways and to varying degrees, including the way tourism firms create value, the competitive landscape of tourism activities, or how firms communicate and engage with partners, suppliers, and customers. The variety, extent, and speed at which these developments are taking place are leaving tourism business owners and managers out of options, as the decision to tackle transformation is no longer a matter of choice, but a must that requires vision, determination, resources, and leadership among key members of the organization.\nFirms that do not invest enough in transformation will find it difficult to survive in the future (OECD, 2020), and those who do not achieve a constant pace of technology adoption and renewal will inevitably lose their competitive edge and the big opportunities ahead (i.e., for innovation and value creation). When digital technologies are used wisely, the potential for growth and improvement for tourism firms is phenomenal (Reddy & Reinartz, 2017). On the contrary, when digital technologies are used without intelligence, everything can end disastrously (Kaivo-Oja et al., 2015).\nIn this cumbersome context, SMEs are at high risk of being left behind, so it is essential that they start by re-examining their business end-to-end and redesigning it if they are to leverage on the promises and gain the benefits of transformation in terms of efficiency, agility, and competitiveness (Busulwa et al., 2020). Doing so requires not only that business owners and managers understand digital technologies and their implications (e.g., the impact of privacy, cybersecurity, business models, interoperability, scalability, ethics, ecosystems, etc.). It fundamentally requires firms to effectively lead transformation internally as a process that spans the entire organization, from senior management, through middle management, to front-line employees. This is no doubt a big ask for tourism SMEs, which surely explains why so many firms fall short of expectations and lag behind in this endurance race of transformation (Lv et al., 2021).\nIt is obvious that a large number of SMEs do not have anywhere near the resources, talented people, skills, and knowledge necessary to successfully tackle transformation. Although the latest innovations in the field of connectivity, networks, artificial intelligence, Big Data, analytics, and automation, to name just a few examples, are opening new windows of opportunity for SMEs, they are also much more sophisticated and far from the capacity of most SMEs to activate change (Earley, 2014). Furthermore, there are still deeply rooted beliefs in many SMEs about whether it is worth investing the time and money in transformation and turn the organization upside down, since it is hard to predict and quantify the true benefits that transformation can bring and when and where these benefits will emerge. Quite often bad past experiences in the execution of technological projects and mismatches in the realization of expectations have historically contributed to this disbelief.\nIt cannot be denied that there may be a good justification behind these attitudes. No one can attest today, be they consultants, scholars, or technologists, how much or at what precise moment in time transformation will improve customer satisfaction, or the service experience. Notwithstanding the above, it is equally true that no tourism firm can afford today to lose customers, manage its resources inefficiently, or assume failure simply because it is unable to decide in which direction its organization should point in today’s hyper-competitive and technology-centric environment (Nagle et al., 2013). The lack of a clear understanding of the strategic direction that the firm must follow and not having a tourism-specific roadmap focused on creating value (for the organization and the customer) are critical factors that very often prevent firms from advancing in the process of transformation that is needed (Udovita, 2020). Those running a tourism business must understand the fundamental nature of transformation and the implications that technological disruptions are having for organizations. Only after owners and managers are clear on what needs to change to close the gap can it become clear which strategy needs to be executed and which parts of the organization need to take the lead in the new strategic direction. With so much at stake, business leaders need to be aware that failure to act on the opportunities offered by transformation and digital technologies will have lethal consequences for the organization’s ability to survive in the future.\nFor all of the above reasons, this book is fundamentally a call to action for business leaders and organizations alike to get down to work as soon as possible and seize the vast pool of opportunities that exist and grow tourism firms in times of the Smart Revolution. To achieve this there are no shortcuts; only the knowledge, attitude, and resources to implement an action plan can help. That is why you have this book in your hands, so that those who run a tourism SME, or intend to do so, equip themselves with the most relevant knowledge and management practices to devise and implement a smart tourism transformation plan. Firms around the world are looking for leaders who are able to understand this complex world and who know how to address the opportunities of smartization. Now here is your chance to stand out from the crowd."

    "text": "The increasingly influential and sophisticated field of transformation and technology uses a specialized terminology that is often difficult for non-specialists to understand. Stop for a moment and think about all those acronyms, abbreviations, and jargon that are constantly heard and read, such as IoT, AI, Analytics, Big Data, or 5G. It is often difficult to know what they really mean. For many of the owners and managers who are approaching this growing field of knowledge and practice for the first time, or who are still at a beginning level, the language itself becomes a barrier to understanding the key issues. This not only happens with those who do not have prior technical training, but also with the most experienced practitioners due to constant innovation and the new practices and technologies that emerge every day.\nDespite these obvious difficulties, a large part of the reference books and training available on the subject are highly technical or academic and focus primarily on information technology or systems management. By doing so, most authors and trainers miss out on helping business owners and managers understand the terminology and fail to guide them through the process of business transformation and organizational improvement. In addition, owners and managers have grown accustomed to hearing about the phenomenal benefits that some “magic” technologies are bringing to companies, consumers, and society in general, but few people tell them about the failures and bad experiences of those who have tried it before and have not experienced the expected returns despite having invested large amounts of time and money in the process.\nTo fill this gap the book provides readers with an up-to-date framework to understand the key concepts, technologies, and management practices that are crucial to tackle the challenges of smartization and the underlying organizational transformation. Always using an eminently practical approach attached to reality and an perspective independent of the technology industry and consultants, the book highlights both the good things that smart technologies can bring to the tourism firm and the not-so-good things. Special attention is also devoted to the barriers and limitations that owners and managers will encounter in the transformation process and the mistakes that should be avoided.\nThe book delves into the world of digital and smart technologies from a managerial perspective, keeping technical details to the minimum necessary to facilitate understanding of concepts and ideas. It also highlights the opportunities that may arise from the implementation of more than ten key smart technologies, including Big Data, analytics, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, augmented and virtual reality, etc. and how they can shape the tourism firm’s strategy and operations. Furthermore, the book emphasizes the crucial role that people and organizational leaders play in harnessing smart technologies and enabling the organization to pursue efficiency, improve the tourism experience, and gain agility for sustainable competitive advantage. To conclude, an implementation framework that draws on best practices is provided that owners and managers can use as a roadmap to take the first steps in smart transformation and start reaping its benefits. Finally, the author offers his personal vision of what could be the next wave of innovation and disruption that is yet to come in the field of smartization and transformation and that could mark the future of tourism firms.\nA variety of discussion questions are provided throughout the chapters of the book to allow current and future business leaders to engage with the concepts and internalize the importance of the ideas presented. In cases where the book is used by groups of undergraduate or graduate students, this material can help stimulate class discussion about the relevance of the ideas presented by the instructor and thus achieve a more collaborative and experiential learning.\nAfter reading the book, anyone running a tourism SME should have a broader understanding of the relationships between organizational transformation, smart technologies, and the management practices that can unlock the wealth of opportunities that they offer. Whoever reads the book carefully should also be prepared to set a plan that optimizes the firm’s strategy and its operations in the context of the Smart Revolution and lead the organization towards the technological developments that are to come. Those readers will also understand that a successful smart transformation process does not depend solely on technology, but that the role that leadership and people play in mobilizing the organization and aligning it with common goals is essential. Ultimately, owners and managers who read the book will be more confident the next time they find themselves in a position to lead a transformation project within their organization or are asked by senior management to lend their support on transformation initiatives. They will surely be better equipped than others to serve as agents of change and contribute to increasing the firm’s performance by keeping up with the accelerated pace of change and innovation that characterizes the era of smart tourism."

In this case the book provides the reader an understanding of the key concepts that are shaping the Smart Revolution in tourism firms, as well as the factors that affect the creation and destruction of value in organizations and how to manage them.\nFor those owners and managers with a track record of managing technology disruption, change initiatives, or who have already embarked on digital/smart transformation processes, the book provides valuable guidance to further explore the management framework that is applicable to the tourism firm to succeed in implementing the smart transformation and unlock its benefits.\nAlthough each chapter has been written to be read and understood on its own, it is highly recommended that beginning and experienced owners and managers alike first read the book from cover to cover before deciding to skip to specific chapters. This will allow them to get a more detailed insight into the key concepts, the relationships between them, and the consequences that arise for the management of the smart transformation in the tourism firm. Experienced owners and managers will thus be able to update their understanding of the main building blocks that shape modern smart transformation and the new management practices that have emerged to harness them. However, if owners and managers feel that they have enough knowledge and experience or are already familiar with the key ideas in this book, they are free to skip directly to the parts or chapters of the book that are of most help or interest to them."

Part 2 focuses on understanding the technologies that are the basis of the Smart Revolution, not from a deep technical or functional perspective, but from the positive (and negative) impacts that their implementation is starting to have, and the transformation needs for the tourism firm. Part 3 contains six chapters that examine some of the main management practices that tourism organizations should consider implementing in order to make a successful transition from conventional to smart firm. Finally, Part 4 aims to guide business leaders in the first steps of the smart business transformation process, as well as to suggest some of the trends that will continue to disrupt tourism firms in the future.\nEach of the 23 chapters of the book is self-contained and can be studied on its own. However, the author recommends that the reader make a first complete reading of the book from beginning to end and follow the established order of the parts and chapters. In this way, the reader will better comprehend the key concepts covered in the book, the relationships between them, and the consequences for the smart management of the tourism firm. After a first reading of the book, readers will realize the true dimension of the Smart Revolution and will feel more comfortable to later delve into specific chapters to review or search for ideas, learn more through the references provided or use the discussion questions at the end of the chapters to stimulate debate and reflection."

    "section": "5.1 The Origins of Smart Tourism",
    "text": "5.1 The Origins of Smart Tourism\nThe road to where we are today has been littered with disruptive changes that previous generations had to respond to and adapt to, no doubt. Those people had to struggle to find the right mix of entrepreneurship, innovation, and technology adoption that would allow them to leap forward. Is it something different now? Not at all. Now it is our turn to do the same because we have entered a comparable historical moment.\nIn tourism, the rapid development of ICT has led to similar phases of progress that nonetheless have their own particularities. Until now, traditional tourism activities were based on close personal relationships, mutual trust, and personal attention. At a business level, the tourism ecosystem was dominated by a few large companies that influenced tourists’ decisions almost at will, monopolizing value offers in the world’s main tourism markets. On the other hand, consumers did not usually complain and accepted the conditions imposed by the big operators, grateful to be able to enjoy a vacation without unpleasant surprises and at prices adjusted to their purchasing power.\nThe advent of Google changed the rules of the game. The swift popularization of search engines allowed prospective tourists to access information from hundreds of tourism service providers and compare them in a matter of seconds. That was only the beginning of a story of sweeping changes to come in the way tourism consumers and businesses interacted, which continues to this day. Unimaginable new business models began to emerge that replaced many of the traditional models and sought to satisfy entirely new market niches and facilitate consumer decision-making. It was in these times that travel blogs, recommendation sites, and price comparison systems started to appear (Zsarnoczky, 2018).\nThe accelerated adoption of digital and online media by consumers meant that tourism firms had to start thinking very seriously about the need to change and adapt their “analog” products and services, if not to create them from scratch. Designing products from the perspective of the “new tourist” began to become a necessity. Since then, getting to know the “new tourist” in depth has become an integral part of the design of business models, and of products and services. Nowadays it would be simply unthinkable for a tourism firm to survive in the market without having this knowledge.\nChallenged by this avalanche of sweeping changes in the way tourism firms are required to operate, many firms have simply been unable to keep up with the pace of change and have been left out of the market. This would explain the renewal that the tourism ecosystem has experienced in recent years at the business level. Figure 5.1 illustrates the evolution described, from traditional tour operators with a low level of digitalization to the present day, characterized by the digital transformation of operators and the growing but unstoppable integration of smart technologies in tourism firms.\n\n5.1.1 Phase 1: Traditional tourism\nThis phase is characterized by the pervasive influence of tourism service providers on consumer decision-making, as they dominate the tourism ecosystem at a global level. The adoption of ICT by tourism firms is still very low and most are largely unaware of the individual tastes and preferences of their customers.\nInstead, management’s focus is more on continuous quality improvement, the efficient operation of processes, and the generation of economies of scale to improve commercial margins.\n\n\n5.1.2 Phase 2: e-Tourism\nThis second phase (1990–2000) is marked by the integration of the internet into the daily lives of consumers and tourism firms. Firms realize the need to be on the internet to serve a growing number of potential customers and the great potential of the World Wide Web as a sales and marketing tool.Nonetheless, communication with customers remains rudimentary and mostly one-way (e.g., via phone, email, and electronic forms). The websites of tourism firms become shop windows open 24 hours a day to any customer in the world regardless of their physical location, and owners and managers begin to see the electronic channel as a promising source of income generation. Paper is replaced as the main support in communications with customers and tourism firms starting to mass-produce digital content, aware that it can be delivered instantly to the people. New electronic and online marketing tools emerge that contribute to improving business performance.\n\n\n5.1.3 Phase 3: Digital tourism\nIn the next decade (years 2000–2010), the internet consolidates as the main source of information for tourists, and the main channel through which information is shared between consumers and firms. New internet technologies open up the possibility for consumers to search and compare information for their trips in a matter of seconds and for firms to create transactional gateways for their products and services. New intermediaries appear that develop business models unknown until this moment. The consumer becomes a co-creator of content and has a much more influential role in decision-making. Traditional operators are forced to transform their business models if they want to survive, meaning that they need to establish much closer ties with their customers and be willing to personalize their product and service offerings. On the other hand, customers begin to think of tourism as an experience that they themselves are willing to create, and the traditional view of the product or service that cannot be controlled is surpassed.\n\n\n5.1.4 Phase 4: Smart tourism\nStarting from 2010, advances in mobile technologies, communication networks, and cloud computing, accompanied by increasing integration and interoperability between the physical and digital worlds, lay the foundation for the transition to the era of smart tourism. Combined with social networks and Web 2.0 platforms that facilitate two-way communication with consumers, the possibility of co-creating new experiences with users becomes a reality in this phase. All the above creates the opportunity for firms to obtain an amount of data like never before. From now on, the ability to exploit data and turn it into actionable knowledge becomes a crucial factor for firms to create competitive advantages and thrive in the marketplace."

    "section": "5.2 Definition of Smart Tourism",
    "text": "5.2 Definition of Smart Tourism\nNo one doubts that the term smart has become a buzzword nowadays. It is not only used as an adjective to describe people or animals, but we can practically find it in anything that incorporates some technology with which we can interact in a more “intelligent” way, that is, faster, automatic, intuitive, or more efficient (e.g., a television, a sports watch, a motor vehicle, etc.) (Poslad, 2011). The Oxford English Dictionary defines the term smart as something “smart” “controlled by a computer, so that it seems to act intelligently”. So we can ask ourselves, how is the term intelligent defined? In the case of a person, it is the ability to understand and learn things. In the case of a computer or program, it is the ability to store information and use it in new situations.\nAlthough these definitions give us a rough idea of what the term smart means, the truth is that intelligent and smart have some differences that should be considered, especially when we are in a business context. “Smart” usually refers to the ability to adapt to changing situations caused by different customer needs, past experiences, or particular environmental conditions. In this context, technology is one of the key drivers that would enable organizations to speed up response to changing conditions. In “intelligent tourism”, tourists become passive consumers who are offered various options among which they must “intelligently” choose the one that best suits their needs. Different levels of intelligence would thus lead to different types of services and experiences.\nIn this book, the term smart is used to refer to state-of-the-art information systems and processes that provide tourists and firms with relevant information, facilitate better decision-making, greater mobility, and a more pleasurable experience in accordance with the preferences and needs of the tourist at all times (Pinheiro et al., 2021). Smart information systems encompass a wide range of technologies, which can be very useful for the tourism firm depending on the environment and the stage of the experience cycle in which they are used. Some examples include recommendation systems, environmental sensing systems, and ambient intelligence systems. Notwithstanding the foregoing, owners and managers must be aware that the term smart not only covers information systems and digital technologies, but also denotes a process that we will call “smartization”, which transcends the mere technological dimension and implicitly affects other core organizational components such as innovation, leadership, and human capital (Boes et al., 2015). In a similar fashion, when we talk about the adoption of a higher degree of “smartness” through the transformation of the organization, we will be referring to a process that is intrinsically different from the implementation of conventional technologies, and that has a strong relationship with the management practices that must be used to accommodate change within the organization.\nSo, now that we have an idea of what smart means in this book, what do we mean by smart tourism? The notion of smart tourism is a reflection of the profound impact that smart technologies are having on the tourism consumer and on the products and services (Mehraliyev et al., 2020). The importance of smart technologies is increasing as the role of tourism consumers and firms is changing, and with it the boundaries of the tourism ecosystem. Smart tourism is a much broader notion than intelligent tourism, as it emphasizes the results that technology can offer tourists and that require a large amount of information and data to materialize. In smart tourism firms need tourists to be active all the time so that they can provide a huge amount of information that can be collected, processed, analyzed, and transformed into individualized knowledge by firms to deliver accurate products and services to tourists. Whereas smart tourism relies heavily on the availability of data and data processing capabilities to anticipate the needs of tourists, intelligent tourism provides a much more basic utility from the available data and information. As an example, the process of generating a travel route automatically from a small number of inputs provided by the user through a mobile application to which an optimization algorithm is applied, is intelligent. If in the same process information is added about the user’s experience, information about the location where the user is or wants to go, or other information about the user’s buyer profile, personality, etc., this is smart (Y. Li et al., 2017).\nIn summary, smart tourism involves the use of technologies to collect and exploit large amounts of data and provide real-time service delivery to tourists. These so-called smart technologies are not only the internet and mobile devices used to communicate, but also include the infrastructure that integrates hardware, software, and communications, as well as networks that provide real-time data to facilitate faster and more efficient decision-making for stakeholders (Dorcic et al., 2019; Gretzel et al., 2015a). Ultimately, the use of smart technologies by tourism firms largely depends on their ability to collect data in large quantities that can then be transformed into useful knowledge."

    "text": "5.3 What Is Smart Tourism For?\nThe debate in academic and professional forums is still ongoing in trying to reach a definitive and widely accepted conclusion of what smart tourism is and what its main components are. Unfortunately, on many occasions these discussions lead to ideas of little use to owners and managers, who are more concerned with understanding the phenomenon of smartization and how to benefit from it than with theoretical discussions that contribute little or nothing to improving the performance of their business.\nThe fundamentals of smart tourism lie in the tourist. The new applications of smart tourism are activated by the behavior of tourists, so changes in their needs and demands are the real driving force of smart tourism. Any benefits derived from smart tourism will arise from the needs of tourists and changes in their behavior (Y. Li et al., 2017). Consequently, the role of the tourist as an informational asset is essential, as evidenced by the fact that the value of information for tourists, tourism firms, and destinations has not stopped growing in recent years. Without tourist information there simply cannot be smart tourism.\n\n5.3.1 For tourists\nSmart tourism provides tourists with access to more comprehensive, portable,and personalized information based on their needs, allowing them to organize and fine-tune the tourism experience more quickly and accurately. For more and better information to be accessible, tourists must provide relevant connected data about their behavior, demands, or personality, so that tourism firms can deliver accurate digital informational resources at their fingertips (e.g., text, pictures, video) through a variety of devices and technologies. The type of value that tourists obtain in exchange for the data they provide is independent of the way in which tourism firms collect and process that data about their behavior and needs.\n\n\n5.3.2 For owners and managers\nSmart tourism is about building an integrated framework of services and technologies that is comprehensive and provides the tourist with a range of services that are accurate, convenient, and ubiquitous. From a technical perspective, such a framework allows for continuous interaction between the assets of the firm (more specifically between the digital representation of those assets) and the tourist needs to create more meaningful relationships with tourists. In this way, smart tourism provides tourists with entirely new ways of consuming tourism services, and tourism firms with new possibilities to create value through innovative combinations of tourism information, services, and technologies.\nReaders should note that not all tourist information falls within the scope of smart tourism. Indeed, tourists can obtain valuable information from very different sources. Sometimes the information will come from websites; other times from social networks, or even from the tourist information offices of a destination. However, only the information that is ubiquitous and that is delivered to the tourist according to their individual requirements is what we will call smart tourism."

    "section": "5.4 Components of Smart Tourism",
    "text": "5.4 Components of Smart Tourism\nIt is not an easy job trying to summarize in a few pages the most important components that characterize smart tourism and that distinguish it from conventional tourism. Nor could it be exhaustive because any attempt to do so would require much more extensive work. Most likely, it would not be of much value to the reader either since the very idea of smart tourism is not yet fully developed. Even so, the components with which every owner and manager should be familiar and that most directly affect the tourism firm are described below.\nOne of the main components of smart tourism is tourist information. In smart tourism, information is no longer that old static information aimed at poorly differentiated groups of consumers that was delivered through a few channels enabled by firms in a rather unstructured way. In contrast, the information in smart tourism is ubiquitous, and is created to meet the individual needs of the tourist. The ubiquity of information means that tourists can easily access information from anywhere, at any time, and through any type of media on the internet. Access to tourist information is provided through devices that are part of everyday life for most people and that provide tourists with a large portable computing capacity, such as mobile devices, portable devices, and other non-conventional means. The very idea of ubiquity implies that, through smart tourism, people have overcome the limitation of having to sit in front of a desktop computer to access tourist information and services. Instead, it involves a radically new way of shaping space and time to the individual needs of the tourist.\nUbiquity, however, not only encompasses information, but also the tourism firm itself, to the point that we could speak of the “ubiquitous firm”. These are firms that have the ability to provide, optimize, and improve services as they are delivered, using ubiquitous marketing, ubiquitous supply chain, and ubiquitous management. The target of the ubiquitous firm is no longer the group of tourists (understood as a set of consumers who share certain attributes that make them similar in the eyes of the firm and for whom generic products and services are created), but the tourist as an individual. This means that smart tourism firms remain focused on individuals with special needs, who have an autonomous behavior that makes them different from other tourists and with the ability to establish their own preferences through the (ubiquitous and bidirectional) communication channels made available by the firm.\nSmart tourism firms devote their resources (e.g., people, money, infrastructure, etc.) to create and capture value from the data generated by the behavior of tourists at any given time. This is what we call business development the smart way. In other words, smart tourism firms’ development depends to a great extent on Big Data and their ability to extract value from it through more relevant relationships with tourists and improved products/services. To create more relevant relationships between tourists and firms another key component must be considered: the smart tourism ecosystem.\nSmart tourism firms operate within an ecosystem in which tourism products/ services (and experiences) are created, managed, and delivered through smart technologies. These technologies are very special because they require the intensive use and constant exchange of information resources to, from, and between tourists, tourism firms, and destinations, to create shared value from the Big Data (Gretzel et al., 2015b). Smart technologies are basically those ICTs that allow constant communication and interaction with tourists, from whose behavior and demands data is extracted that can later be exploited by the tourism firm to generate useful knowledge for the business. Note that the smart tourism ecosystem would simply not work if the actors involved were isolated or separated from each other. They must be connected through (smart) technologies, with the tourist located in the center so that the smart ecosystem can work properly.\nThis tourist-centric approach that characterizes smart tourism is part of its idiosyncrasy and is another of the key components that differentiate it from conventional tourism. Business owners and managers should not forget that smart tourism is created with the aim of satisfying the individual travel, mobility, accommodation, catering, and leisure needs of tourists based on their personal preferences. The tourist-centric approach of tourism firms is made possible thanks to the rapid advances and intensive use of smart technologies (e.g., Big Data, analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, mobile and network technologies with high computing capacity and connectivity). The adoption of smart technologies into the consumption habits of tourists has forever transformed the way they consume tourism products/services and enjoy tourism experiences.\nTourism firms’ use of smart (customer-centric) technologies puts them in a privileged position to meet the individual demands of tourists and improve satisfaction levels. It also provides tourism firms with the opportunity to radically improve their products/services and revamp tourism experiences through the implementation of new and innovative management practices that optimize the use of internal and external resources and are aimed at co-creating value with tourists, destinations, and the ICT industry. In short, smart tourism with all its components constitutes a framework for action to improve the management of tourism firms that can contribute very significantly to improving their competitiveness and performance."

    "section": "5.5 Impact of Smart Tourism",
    "text": "5.5 Impact of Smart Tourism\nThe process of change towards smartization is a breakthrough that confirms the transition of the tourism sector towards a modern service industry. This process brings highly relevant impacts that will undoubtedly be the catalysts for the future developments of tourism in the coming years. As we have seen, smart tourism builds on top of earlier phases of social and business development, when everything was more focused on the informatization and digitization of the tourism business. That is why it is worth examining the most notorious impacts that smart tourism is having on consumers and firms.\n\n5.5.1 Impacts on tourism firms\nOne of the key benefits of smart tourism for firms is that it provides a two-way communication channel between tourism firms, tourists and the rest of the actors involved in the value chain. “Smart channels” are created that operate as high-speed highways through which a constant flow of data and information circulates and is disseminated in a rather personalized and efficient way among all tourism stakeholders. In this way, smart tourism strongly impacts the commercialization and marketing of tourism products/services, given the variety of media that can be used (e.g., text, images, videos, and hybrid combinations), the ability to monitor the demand and quality of the services provided, and the possibility of quantitatively measuring the performance of campaigns.\nFrom a management perspective, smart tourism offers tourism firms the opportunity to configure their own value offer to the customer in a quite flexible way, activating a much deeper knowledge about the customer that translates into delivering information, products, and services in accordance with the location and the requirements of the customer. However, achieving “smartness” is not straightforward. It requires the firm to redesign its internal processes, so that integration with smart technologies is seamless and contributes to improving the operational efficiency of the firm’s business. For example, a hotel can have room check-in and check-out done via radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems, or the tourist can read a menu, book a table, and have access to entertainment services in the room all through the same mobile device.\nOne consequence of the above is that the tourism firm can end up optimizing itself thanks to smart tourism while changing the way it relates to the customer. The customer, in turn, may change behavior when searching for information and consuming tourism products/services to enjoy all the advantages that smart tourism promises.\n\n\n5.5.2 Impacts on the tourist\nSmart tourism and its components impact the tourist in several ways, including the experience, satisfaction, behavior, and decision-making (Mehraliyev et al., 2020). Smart tourism can enhance the tourist experience by fostering greater engagement and interaction with and between tourists, and promoting the exchange of experiences (Buonincontri & Micera, 2016). For example, today it is easy for tourists to share their travel experience in many different ways: they can post photos and videos of their trip, or write a review to share information with their family and friends on social media. Geocaching is another example that shows how the experiences of younger tourists can be enhanced by diversifying and gamifying the activities they enjoy in a destination (Skinner et al., 2018).\nSmart tourism facilitates tourist planning and decision-making before and during travel, e.g., “smart travel guides” that allow interaction between content and the tourist in a highly dynamic way (Chuang, 2020; Ruíz et al., 2017). By using smart technologies, tourists are less constrained by the arrangements they make before they leave on a trip, as destination information is readily available wherever they are during their trip. Moreover, tourists can obtain relevant information for their trip through websites or mobile applications based on their previous behavior, consumption patterns, and browsing records on the networks and the internet. This allows tourists to adapt their consumption throughout the trip, as their needs change or they discover new information on an on-going basis (Y. Li et al., 2017). The result is that tourists can end up becoming much more unpredictable consumers than before. One consequence of the above is that the efforts made by tourism firms to improve tourist satisfaction (through smart technologies and process reengineering) are increasing day by day, for example, by implementing automatic billing processes in self-service restaurants through the use of neural networks (Aguilar et al., 2018), by installing lighting control systems in hotel rooms to improve the quality of service (Feng et al., 2017), by developing dynamic software tools that allow the characteristics of hotel rooms to be adjusted according to the activities carried out by the customer (Cetina et al., 2013), or by promoting the use of virtual and augmented reality systems to experience tourist attractions in a more enjoyable way.\nLast but not least, another important impact is related to consumer preferences when it comes to adopting smart technologies and smart information. Although this is an area that needs more research, there are some studies that highlight that ease of use and perceived usefulness are key factors influencing consumer attitudes towards smart technologies (Bae et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2015). Other factors, such as informativeness, interactivity, accessibility, and personalization are also highly relevant (Chung & Koo, 2015). In conclusion, it is important that tourism firms are aware of the factors that affect their customers and users when adopting smart tourism, and that they understand how tourists prefer to enjoy tourism experiences (e.g., “more smart”, “less smart”). This is a field of knowledge that will gradually gain in importance and that is very likely to change the way in which tourism firms segment and interact with customers."

    "section": "5.6 Criticism of Smart Tourism",
    "text": "5.6 Criticism of Smart Tourism\nThe tacit consensus reached among most academics, consultants, and leaders from the technology industry reveals an overly optimistic view of the effects of smart tourism, both for tourism firms and tourists. It often happens that many of the benefits that are continually pointed out by industry and academia are poorly supported by empirical data, which advises owners and managers to be cautious in trusting the promised benefits and the ease of obtaining them. This does not mean that owners and managers should distrust smart tourism recommendations by default, but rather that many slogans have been widely criticized due to the lack of studies to support them.\nThe first criticism has to do with the limited empirical evidence that academic and industry research has provided in recent years on the benefits of smart tourism, beyond highly specific case studies. In addition, the little practical research that has been carried out in this respect has provided very limited theoretical advances, which prevents establishing broad generalizations that cover all tourism activities and firms, since they have no validity beyond the isolated case studies investigated.\nA second criticism is that the study on smart tourism has been carried out on very few fronts (e.g., destinations, specific smart technologies, the tourist experience, combined effects with other technologies). This means that there is neither a solid body of empirical evidence nor an elaborate theoretical framework that is exclusive to tourism and on which we can base conclusions about the real impacts that smart tourism has on tourism firms. This lack of understanding about the business perspective of smart tourism means that the answer to the question of how smart tourism actually affects tourism firms, and what factors limit its adoption, remains open.\nThe third criticism relates to the lack of understanding about tourist preferences, as it is still hard to know for sure which aspects of smart tourism are most (or least) preferred by tourists, or which segments of tourists are those most/least likely to choose smart tourism. Ultimately, what owners and managers should note is that there is a general absence of solidly grounded discourse on the impacts and consequences of smart tourism. This leads us to point out the significant limitations that exist in determining the drivers, drawbacks, and costs associated with implementing a smart tourism strategy in the tourism firm. Therefore, business owners and managers should take a critical standpoint, aware that not all the effects of the Smart Revolution are positive for the tourism firm. There is still a long way to go in identifying, measuring, and mitigating the negative effects and drawbacks of smart tourism in real life, and only more and better empirical work will help clarify the pros and cons.\n\n5.6.1 e-Lienation\nOne of the most studied negative aspects of smart tourism is that of e-lienation, which highlights the negative impact that ICTs have on the consumer’s own experience (Tribe & Mkono, 2017). According to these authors, there is sufficient evidence to affirm that the use of smart technologies can promote isolation and addiction on the part of the consumer, as well as self-marginalization, loss of routines, and even the breaking of social ties and misconduct when complying with rules, uses, and customs. These behavioral alterations that can affect the consumer, both in an individual and social context, can even pose a threat to the restorative purpose sought by the tourist with a trip or vacation. Circumstances like this are more frequent than most think and they happen when tourists have a hard time disconnecting from their work obligations and take their computer and mobile devices on a getaway or on vacation, or when they feel obsessed with chatting and sending emails to friends and family at home, or keep tweeting or posting on Facebook and Instagram to show the world their “perfect self in the perfect place”.\nThese behaviors are a reflection of e-lienation and can negatively influence the quest for authenticity of tourist experiences to the point of reinforcing anxiety, narcissism, and addiction. Of course, not all the uses that tourists make of ICT have to end in e-lienation, but it seems evident that the more we use ICT in our leisure and tourism time, the more opportunities arise to suffer from e-lienation (Tribe & Mkono, 2017). Business owners and managers need to be aware of these circumstances and the negativities they can bring to the tourism experience. This means being able to identify the critical factors that can lead to e-lineation before deciding to undertake a transformation strategy that involves the implementation of smart technologies and organizational change."
