Tourism is an extraordinarily information-rich industry. The shift in focus to the tourism "experience", coupled with the highly competitive environment, pushes tourism firms to focus more on information and data. The collection, storage, organization, processing, and dissemination of information thus become crucial parts of the performance of tourism firms. In this context, the success of tourism firms depends on the creation of new knowledge from the data and information that is available and, more specifically, on the rapid and timely integration of relevant knowledge for decision-making (Kaivo-Oja et al., 2015; Nikolskaya et al., 2021).

The use of data by firms is nothing new. It has always been at the root of successful business management. What has changed today is that data, which used to be expensive and scarce, is now everywhere (users and consumers generate data all the time), has new properties (since it is meta-tagged), it is produced in real time, and it comes from many different sources and in many varied formats (e.g., texts, images, videos, audios). Its size and relevance for business and society has reached such relevance that many call this moment the "data revolution" or the "Big Data Era", and include the set of innovative technologies and techniques focused on collecting, storing, managing, and analyzing large data sets that could not otherwise be dealt with by conventional data management methods (Bashkirova, 2016).

Industries around the world collect all sorts of data and information from customers, suppliers, partners, and even from competitors. There is also a growing need at the organizational level for new capacities to tackle the growing complexity of the tourism ecosystem and the needs arising from digitalization. Today, firms' digital touch points with customers are many and varied, allowing the entire customer life cycle (before, during, and after the purchase) to be recorded for later analysis. Distributed sensors can also record what is happening in a physical environment, transmitting information wirelessly or over a fixed broadband network wherever there is the ability to use it. Additionally, renewed interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning tools is accelerating business transformation due to their promise of stronger analytics capabilities and systems that are more powerful and can operate in a more automated way (Berntsson Svensson & Taghavianfar, 2020).

The result is a tremendously complex landscape with an exponential amount of data flowing through hundreds or even thousands of applications, which in turn is leading to an accelerated growth in the capabilities of the firms to do something with it, such as storing, processing, and presenting it (Andersen et al., 2018). For organizations this massive flow of data is proving very difficult to manage and extracting real value from it has become a daunting challenge, even more so for organizations with decades of history in IT management that have never managed data as an asset.

In this regard, the successful transformation to a data-driven organization involves the widespread application of the latest technologies in data storage, processing, and knowledge creation/ integration. Furthermore, any information related process in a modern organization relies on dozens or more applications that typically have their own internal data model, their own interfaces, and even require their own expertise. This very often far exceeds the capabilities of what any individual in an organization can comprehend. For this reason, many organizations have appointed chief data officers (CDOs), in charge of managing the data in the organization, and data scientists, who receive, examine, and analyze data of all kinds in search of value for the business.

Far from diminishing, the sheer volume of data will continue to grow in the coming years, regardless of the size and type of organization. Data calls for more data, thus forming an upward spiral in which data is constantly increasing and less understood (Chessell et al., 2018). Converting all this data, the vast majority of which is unstructured, into structured knowledge will be one of the main challenges for the aspiring smart firm. In addition, firms that want to gain market share should become familiar with knowledge management methods and systems (Bashkirova, 2016) that can help improve firm performance. Indeed, some authors have reported that there is a correlation between business performance and the organization's use of data analytics and knowledge, whether for efficiency, growth, or competitive differentiation. High-performing organizations are using data to make decisions more than twice as often as low-performing organizations, and for a wide variety of decisions, big and small (LaValle et al., 2011).

However, tourism SMEs still do not use data much to create value and there is still a long way to go in this regard (Del Vecchio et al., 2018). Nowadays, tourism firms seem more concerned with implementing digital technologies and infrastructures focused on their daily operations (e.g., reservation systems, websites, information management systems), despite the relevance that data is acquiring to improve the competitiveness of any tourism business. The penetration of these technologies is also very different within and between the different tourism subsectors, as well as their impact on the growth of tourism firms. This makes data a central issue that tourism firms need to start acting upon to continue creating value for stakeholders. Business owners and managers have no more time to lose and should start planning for the transition to a data-driven organization.

## The Value of Data

The transformation of traditional tourism firms into data-driven organizations mainly affects the organizational processes of the organization, the allocation
of internal and external resources, and even the long-standing customs and culture of the people. Ultimately, these transformational changes aim to make
the business more agile and responsive to customer demands, that is, more 
customer-oriented in every way.

Smart technologies can provide a major boost to the transformational effort of tourism firms if supported by proven standards embedded in technology platforms and everyday data-driven tools (e.g., tools and platforms that automate data storage, classification, and analysis). Furthermore, new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, real-time customer intelligence, analytics for prediction and personalization of services, to name a few, are already key to creating value and driving major changes throughout the tourism ecosystem.

But what exactly is "data" and why is it so valuable? Data is a collection of observations, measurements, facts, or even raw representations of phenomena that are not organized in any particular way and do not contain any apparent meaning. Data is the basic unit used to register events, activities, operations, or transactions. Data differs from typical organizational resources as it enables replicable services at almost zero marginal cost. It also provides great flexibility of use regardless of the device it runs on (Veit et al., 2014). However, data alone is useless unless it can be interpreted and made meaningful, and to make this possible, organizations must integrate data with analytics technologies. Data analysis thus activates a process of transforming the value of the data by which data pass through three different value states: "raw data", "information", and "knowledge" (Fig. 8.1). This is a sequential process where raw data is first collected, organized, and transformed into a stream of interpreted data called information, and subsequently transformed into usable knowledge through intellectual operations that provide more value to information (Monino, 2021). Through data analytics, organizations have the potential to harness data to uncover previously unseen market insights and business opportunities.

Tourism firms have used data, even big data sets, for a long time, and they have a natural tendency to store all kinds of data. What distinguishes the present moment from any previous one is the ability that firms now have to combine these vast amounts of data with innovative manipulation and knowledge generation techniques (e.g., Big Data, analytics, artificial intelligence, etc.) and consequently boost innovation and business performance (Tsaih & Hsu, 2018).
Forecasts predict that the amount of data stored worldwide will increase fivefold, from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to 175 zettabytes in 2025 (Reinsel et al., 2018). The aftermath is a market for Big Data technology that is projected to grow from US$41.3 billion to US$116.1 billion in 2027 (Fortune Business Insights, 2020). Both are clear indicators that show tourism firms how the economic value of data is a key factor that cannot be ignored and that firms are experiencing an unequivocal transition from an economy based on tangible assets to one based on intangibles (Mihet & Philippon, 2018). Tourism firms should therefore not delay in adopting this process of change and start integrating data into all new and existing processes.
